       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='Preface\\nBuilding on the success of previous editions, Med-\\nical Terminology Systems, 8th edition, continues its\\nwell-established record of presenting medical\\nword building principles based on competency-\\nbased curricula. Because of the pedagogical success\\nof previous editions, the 8th edition continues its\\nstructural design as a textbook–workbook that\\ncomplements all teaching formats, including tradi-\\ntional lecture, distance learning, and independent\\nor self-paced study. The 8th edition continues \\nto present eponyms without showing the posses-\\nsive form, such as Bowman capsule, Cushing syn-\\ndrome, and Parkinson disease. Medical dictionaries\\nas well as the American Association for Medical\\nTranscription and the American Medical Associa-\\ntion support these changes.\\nThe popular basic features of the previous edition\\nhave been enhanced and expanded. The updated\\nbody systems chapters include diseases and condi-\\ntions, current medical and diagnostic procedures,\\ntreatments, and pharmaceutical agents. The text-\\nbook continues to present authentic medical records\\nwith activities designed to enhance application of\\nmedical terminology to the “real world of medi-\\ncine.” This approach provides the essential tools \\nstudents of various learning levels need to commu-\\nnicate eﬀectively in today’s health-care settings.\\nAs in earlier editions, illustrations that clearly and\\naccurately enhance textual material are integrated\\nthroughout the textbook. Medical Terminology \\nSystems, 8th edition, includes over 36 new illustra-\\ntions speciﬁcally designed to portray real-life med-\\nical conditions, procedures, and treatments. The \\nillustrations supplement course content in new and\\ninteresting ways and help make diﬃcult concepts\\nclear. Unique to this edition are innovative illustra-\\ntions created for Chapters 1 through 3 to help stu-\\ndents understand the various applications of suﬃxes\\nand preﬁxes in word building. Also new to the \\n8th edition are Documenting Health-Care Activi-\\nties sections in each body systems chapter. These\\nsections emphasize the role of the electronic medical\\nrecord (EMR) in today’s health-care industry.\\nDocumenting Health-Care Activities are ﬁrst\\nintroduced in Chapter 4, Body Structure. The \\nintroduction provides information related to the\\ntransition of the medical record from a paper med-\\nical chart to a digital version. Reinforcement of this\\nintroduction continues throughout each body sys-\\ntems chapter so that students fully understand how\\ntoday’s digital medical record allows practitioners\\nto electronically monitor and track the history of a\\npatient’s medical treatment.\\nAlthough the fundamental characteristics of\\nthe 8th edition remain the same as those in pre-\\nvious editions, this edition offers significant up-\\ndates and enhancements to aid in the learning\\nprocess and improve retention of medical terms.\\nTo achieve this goal, each illustration in the text-\\nbook presents clinically accurate and aesthetically\\npleasing representations of anatomical structures,\\ndisease conditions, and medical procedures. In\\naddition, ICD-10-PCS replacement terms for dis-\\ncontinued eponyms are summarized in Appendix\\nH. As in previous editions, we continue to incorpo-\\nrate the excellent suggestions oﬀered by instructors\\nand students and appreciate all of their contribu-\\ntions. Undoubtedly, the recommendations have\\nhelped make Medical Terminology Systems: A Body\\nSystems Approach a leading textbook in educational\\ninstitutions and one that continues to be well \\nreceived by instructors and students. Here is a brief\\nsummary of chapter content:\\n• Chapter 1 explains the techniques of medical\\nword building using basic word elements.\\n• Chapter 2 categorizes major surgical, diagnos-\\ntic, symptomatic, and grammatical suﬃxes.\\n• Chapter 3 presents major preﬁxes of position,\\nnumber and measurement, direction, and\\nother parameters.\\n• Chapter 4 introduces anatomical, physiologi-\\ncal, and pathological terms. It also presents\\ncombining forms denoting cellular and body\\nstructures, body position and direction, and \\nregions of the body, in addition to combining\\nforms related to diagnostic methods and\\npathology. General diagnostic and therapeutic\\nterms are described and provide a solid foun-\\ndation for speciﬁc terms addressed in the body\\nsystems chapters that follow.\\n• Chapters 5 through 16are organized according\\nto speciﬁc body systems and may be taught in\\nany sequence. These chapters include key\\nanatomical and physiological terms, basic\\nanatomy and physiology, a body systems con-\\nnections table, and a comprehensive table of\\nword elements, including combining forms, suf-\\nﬁxes, and preﬁxes. The remaining chapter mate-\\nrial consists of a disease focus section, followed\\nby tables that include updated diseases and con-\\nditions; diagnostic, surgical, and therapeutic pro-\\ncedures; pharmacology; and abbreviations. Each\\nbody systems chapter concludes with several\\nlearning activities that assess comprehension \\nof material and medical record activities that \\nix\\n5867_FM_i-xxvi  12/01/17  12:22 PM  Page ix'),\n",

In addition, Taber’s \\ncontains etymologies for nearly all main entries\\npresented in this textbook.\\nDiscontinued Eponyms with\\nICD-10-PCS Replacement\\nTerms\\nICD-10-CM contains the use of eponyms when\\nassigning certain codes for diagnoses and proce-\\ndures. However, all surgical eponyms have been\\nremoved from ICD-10-PCS. In their place are\\nroot terms that describe the objective of the proce-\\ndure and other parameters to assign the proper\\ncode(s). The ICD-10-PCS procedural codes are\\nmore speciﬁc, more clinically accurate, and use a\\nmore logical structure than the previous coding\\nsystems. There are still some diagnostic eponyms\\nin ICD-10-PCS, but most have been replaced by\\na constructed term that identiﬁes the disease or\\ncondition. A summary of eponyms found in this\\ntextbook along with the ICD-10-PCS 2015\\nterm(s) that replace the eponym are summarized\\nin Appendix H of this textbook. \\nWe hope you enjoy this new edition as much as\\nwe enjoyed preparing it.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 27}, page_content='Medical Word Elements\\nThe language of medicine is a specialized vocabulary used by health-care providers. Many current\\nmedical word elements originated as early as the 4th century B.C. when Hippocrates practiced\\nmedicine. With technological and scientiﬁc advancements in medicine, new terms have evolved to\\nreﬂect these innovations. For example, radiographic terms, such as magnetic resonance imaging\\n(MRI) and ultrasound (US), are now commonly used to describe current diagnostic procedures.\\nA medical word consists of some or all of the following elements:\\n• word root\\n• combining form\\n• suﬃx\\n• preﬁx.\\nHow these elements are combined and whether all or some of them are present in a medical\\nterm determines the meaning of a word. To understand the meaning of medical words, it is\\nimportant to learn how to divide them into their basic elements. The purpose of this chapter\\nis to cover the basic principles of medical word building and learn how to pronounce the terms\\ncorrectly. Thus, pronunciations of medical terms are provided throughout the textbook. In \\naddition, pronunciation guidelines are located on the inside back cover of this book. They can\\nbe used as a convenient reference to help pronounce terms correctly.\\nWord Roots\\nA word root is the foundation of a medical term and contains its primary meaning. All medical\\nterms have at least one word root. Most word roots are derived from the Greek or Latin language;\\nthus, two diﬀerent roots may have the same meaning. For example, the Greek word dermatos and\\nthe Latin word cutane both refer to the skin. As a general rule, Greek roots describe a disease,\\ncondition, treatment, or diagnosis. Latin roots describe anatomical structures. Consequently, the\\nGreek root dermat describes a disease, condition, treatment, or diagnosis of the skin; the Latin\\nroot cutane describes an anatomical structure. (See Table 1-1.)\\n2 CHAPTER 1 \\x81 Basic Elements of a Medical Word\\nTable 1-1 Examples of Word Roots\\nThis table lists examples of English terms with their Greek and Latin origins as well as word\\nanalyses of corresponding medical terms. Phonetic pronunciations are provided to help you \\npractice pronouncing the medical terms.\\nEnglish Term Greek or Latin Term* Word Root Word Analysis\\nskin\\nkidney\\ndermatos (Gr)\\ncutis (L)\\nnephros (Gr)\\nrenes (L)\\ndermat\\ncutane\\nnephr\\nren\\ndermat/itis (d˘er-m˘a-T¯I-t˘ıs): inflammation\\nof the skin\\nDermatitis is a general term used to de-\\nscribe an inflammatory condition of the skin.\\ncutane/ous (k¯u-T ¯A-n¯e-˘us): pertaining to\\nthe skin\\nCutaneous is a term that identifies an\\nanatomical structure.\\nnephr/oma (n˘e-FR ¯O-m˘a): tumor of the\\nkidney\\nNephroma is a tumor (benign or malig-\\nnant) of kidney tissue.\\nren/al (R¯E-n˘al): pertains to the kidney\\nRenal is a term that identifies an anatom-\\nical structure.\\n5867_Ch01_001-014  11/01/17  11:15 AM  Page 2'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 28}, page_content='Combining Forms\\nA combining form is created when a word root is combined with a vowel. The vowel, known as\\na combining vowel, is usually an o but is sometimes an i. The combining vowel has no meaning\\nof its own but enables the connection of two or more word elements. Like a word root, a com-\\nbining form is the basic foundation to which other word elements are added to build a complete\\nmedical word. In this text, a combining form will be listed as word root/vowel (such as gastr/o), as\\nillustrated in Table 1-2.\\nSuffixes\\nA suﬃx is a word element placed at the end of a word that alters its meaning. All medical terms\\nhave a suﬃx. In the terms pancreat/itis (inﬂammation of the pancreas) and pancreat/o/pathy (disease\\nof the pancreas), the suﬃxes are -itis (inﬂammation) and -pathy (disease). In medical terminology,\\na suﬃx usually describes a pathology (disease or abnormality), symptom, surgical or diagnostic pro-\\ncedure, or part of speech.\\nTo link a suﬃx that begins with a vowel, use a word root.

A micr/o/cyte is a small cell.\\nSee Table 3-1 for other examples of how a preﬁx changes the meaning of a word.\\nPrefix Types\\nLearning the major types of preﬁxes, such as preﬁxes of position, number and measurement, and\\ndirection, as well as some others, will help you master medical terminology.\\nPrefixes of Position, Number, Measurement, \\nand Direction\\nPreﬁxes used in medical terms denote position, number and measurement, and direction. Preﬁxes\\nof position describe a place or location. (See Table 3-2.) Preﬁxes of number and measurement de-\\nscribe an amount, size, or degree of involvement. (See Table 3-3.)

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 71}, page_content='Cells\\nThe cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of life. Body cells perform all activities \\nassociated with life, including utilizing food, facilitating reproduction, and eliminating waste\\nproducts. Cells have many shapes and sizes, but they share three main structures: cell membrane,\\ncytoplasm, and nucleus. The study of the body at the cellular level is called cytology.\\nCell Membrane and Cytoplasm\\nThe cell membrane acts as a barrier that supports and protects the intracellular contents. Within\\nthe cell membrane is a jellylike matrix of proteins, salts, water, dissolved gases, and nutrients called\\ncytoplasm.Inside the cytoplasm are specialized structures called organelles. These organelles per-\\nform speciﬁc functions of the cell, such as reproduction and digestion. The largest cell organelle is\\nthe nucleus, which directs the cell’s activities and contains chromosomes.\\nNucleus\\nThe nucleus is responsible for metabolism, growth, and reproduction. It also carries the genetic\\nblueprint of the organism. This blueprint is found in a complex molecule called deoxyribonu-\\ncleic acid (DNA) that is organized into a threadlike structure called chromatin. When the cell\\nis ready to divide, chromatin forms chromosomes, which carry thousands of genes that make\\nup our genetic blueprint. Each body cell, with the exception of the female ovum and the male\\nspermatozoa, contains 23 pairs of chromosomes that determine its genetic makeup. In each of\\nthe 23 pairs, one of the chromosomes was inherited from the mother and the other from the \\nfather. About 20,000–25,000 genes in the body determine unique human characteristics. Genes\\npass biological information from one generation to the next. This biological information \\nincludes such traits as hair color, body structure, and metabolic activity.\\nTissues\\nTissue is composed of similar cells that perform specialized or common functions. The study of\\ntissues is called histology. Between the cells that make up tissues are varying amounts and types\\nof nonliving, intercellular substances that provide pathways for cellular interaction. The body \\ncontains four types of tissues:\\n• Epithelial tissue covers surfaces of organs, lines cavities and canals, forms tubes and ducts,\\nprovides the secreting portions of glands, and makes up the outer layer (epidermis) of the\\nskin. It is composed of cells arranged in a continuous sheet consisting of one or more layers.\\n• Connective tissue supports and connects other body tissues. There are various types of \\nconnective tissue, including cartilage, adipose (fat), bone, elastic ﬁber, and even blood.\\n• Muscle tissue provides the contractile tissue of the body, which is responsible for movement.\\n• Nervous tissue transmits electrical impulses as it relays information throughout the \\nentire body.\\nOrgans\\nOrgans are body structures that perform specialized functions. They are composed of two or more\\ntissue types. For example, the stomach is made up of connective tissue, muscle tissue, epithelial tissue,\\nand nervous tissue. Muscle and connective tissue form the wall of the stomach. Epithelial and con-\\nnective tissue cover the inner and outer surfaces of the stomach. Nervous tissue penetrates the epithe-\\nlial lining of the stomach and its muscular wall to stimulate the release of chemicals for digestion.\\nSystems\\nA body system is composed of varying numbers of organs and accessory structures that have similar\\nor related functions. For example, organs of the gastrointestinal system include the esophagus,\\nstomach, small intestine, and colon. Some of its accessory structures include the liver, gallbladder,\\nand pancreas. The main function of the digestive system is to digest food, remove and absorb its\\nnutrients, and expel waste products.\\n46 CHAPTER 4 \\x81 Body Structure\\n5867_Ch04_043-080  11/01/17  11:17 AM  Page 46'),\n",

An organism is a complete living entity capable\\nof independent existence. All complex organisms, including humans, are made up of several body\\nsystems that work together to sustain life.\\nAnatomical Position\\nAnatomical position is a body posture used among anatomists and clinicians as a position of \\nreference to ensure uniformity and consistency in locating anatomical parts or divisions of the \\nhuman body. In the anatomical position, the person stands erect, facing forward, and the arms\\nare at the sides of the body, with the palms of the hands turned forward and the feet parallel to\\neach another. No matter how the body is actually positioned—standing or lying down, facing \\nforward or backward—or how the limbs are actually placed, the positions and relationships of a\\nstructure are always described as if the body were in the anatomical position.\\nBody Planes\\nA plane is an imaginary ﬂat surface that divides the body into two sections. When the body is in\\nanatomical position, the planes serve as points of reference to identify the diﬀerent sections of the\\nbody. The most commonly used planes are coronal (frontal), transverse (horizontal), and mid-\\nsagittal (median). The section is named for the plane along which it is cut. A coronal (frontal)\\nplane divides the body into an anterior and posterior section; a transverse (horizontal) plane di-\\nvides the body into top and bottom sections. The midsagittal plane runs through the center of\\nthe body, dividing the body into right and left halves. (See Fig. 4-2.)\\nBefore the development of modern imaging techniques, standard x-ray images showed only \\na single plane, and many body abnormalities were diﬃcult, if not impossible, to see.

Thus, structural abnormalities\\nand body masses that were previously not found using a standard single plane x-ray are now \\ndetected with scanning devices that show images taken in several body planes.\\nDirectional Terms\\nDirectional terms help indicate the position of structures, surfaces, and regions of the body. These\\nterms are always identiﬁed relative to the anatomical position. For example, the knee is superior\\nto the ankle; the legs are inferior to the trunk. Refer to Figure 4-3 to locate the directional terms\\nsuperior and inferior. Physicians commonly use directional terms in medical reports and in com-\\nmunications with other health-care providers and patients. Directional terms identify the location\\nof diseases, injuries, and surgical sites. In a clinical setting, health-care providers may describe the\\nlocation of a heart attack to the patient as occurring in the front, or anterior, part of the heart. A\\ntumor on the back of the kidney may be described as being located on the posterior surface of the\\nkidney.

The body has two main cavities: the dorsal cavity, located on the back of the body\\n(posterior), and the ventral cavity, located on the front of the body (anterior). (See Fig. 4-4.)\\nDorsal Cavity\\nThe dorsal cavity is divided into the cranial cavity and the spinal cavity. The cranial cavity,\\nformed by the skull, contains the brain; the spinal cavity, formed by the backbone (spine), con-\\ntains the spinal cord. The meninges are the membranes that line these cavities and also cover the\\nbrain and spinal cord. The dorsal cavity is continuous; no wall or structure separates the cranial\\ncavity from the spinal cavity.\\nVentral Cavity\\nThe ventral cavity is divided into the thoracic cavity and abdominopelvic cavity. The thoracic cavity\\nis separated from the abdominopelvic cavity by a muscular wall called the diaphragm. The tho-\\nracic cavity contains the lungs and heart. The abdominal pelvic cavity is further divided into the\\nabdominal cavity and pelvic cavity. The abdominal cavity contains the liver, stomach, intestines,\\nand kidneys. The pelvic cavity, positioned inferior to the abdominal cavity, contains the urinary\\nbladder and reproductive organs, such as the uterus in women and the prostate gland in men. \\nExamine the divisions of the ventral cavity in Figure 4-4.\\nBody Cavities 49\\nTable 4-1 Directional Terms\\nThis table provides a comprehensive summary of directional terms, along with their definitions.\\nOpposing terms are presented consecutively to aid memorization.\\nTerm Definition\\nAbduction\\nAdduction\\nMedial\\nLateral\\nSuperior (cephalad)\\nInferior (caudal)\\nProximal\\nDistal\\nAnterior (ventral)\\nPosterior (dorsal)\\nParietal\\nVisceral\\nProne\\nSupine\\nInversion\\nEversion\\nPalmar\\nPlantar\\nSuperficial\\nDeep\\nMovement away from the midsagittal (median) plane of the body or one of its parts\\nMovement toward the midsagittal (median) plane of the body\\nPertaining to the midline of the body or structure\\nPertaining to a side\\nToward the head or upper portion of a structure\\nAway from the head, or toward the tail or lower part of a structure\\nNearer to the center (trunk of the body) or to the point of attachment to the body\\nFurther from the center (trunk of the body) or from the point of attachment to the body\\nFront of the body\\nBack of the body\\nPertaining to the outer wall of the body cavity\\nPertaining to the viscera, or internal organs, especially the abdominal organs\\nLying on the abdomen, face down\\nLying horizontally on the back, face up\\nTurning inward or inside out\\nTurning outward\\nPertaining to the palm of the hand\\nPertaining to the sole of the foot\\nToward the surface of the body (external)\\nAway from the surface of the body (internal)\\n5867_Ch04_043-080  11/01/17  11:17 AM  Page 49'),\n",

They also need a stable internal environ-\\nment (homeostasis) that provides a narrow range of temperature, water, acidity, and salt concen-\\ntration. When homeostasis is disrupted and cells, tissues, organs, or systems are unable to function\\neﬀectively, the condition is called disease. From a clinical point of view, disease is a pathological,\\nor morbid, condition that presents a group of signs, symptoms, and clinical ﬁndings. Signs are \\nobjective indicators that are observable. A rash, tissue redness, and swelling are examples of \\nsigns. In Figure 4-6, the rash is a sign of rubella (German measles), which is an acute infectious\\ndisease. A symptom (Sx) is a subjective indicator of disease. As such, only the patient can experi-\\nence it. Dizziness, pain, and nausea are examples of symptoms. Clinical ﬁndings are the results of\\nradiological, laboratory, and other medical procedures performed on the patient or the patient’s\\nspecimens. (See Fig. 4-6.)\\nEstablishing a diagnosis (Dx), the cause and nature of a disease, helps in the selection of a\\ntreatment (Tx). A prognosis is the prediction of the course of a disease and its probable outcome.\\nAn idiopathic disease is one whose cause is unknown or exists without any connection with a\\nknown cause. Some diseases, injuries, or treatments cause complications. For example, a head \\ninjury may cause paralysis, and treatment with a toxic drug may cause deafness.\\n5867_Ch04_043-080  11/01/17  11:17 AM  Page 57'),\n",

In other words, it is an electronic version of a paper medical chart. The EMR contains a history of\\nthe patient’s medical care, including diagnoses, treatments, and other vital health information. The digital\\nversion allows practitioners to electronically monitor and track the health status, preventive health services,\\ntreatments, and care planning of patients and serves as a more efficient method of documenting patient\\ncare. The electronic connection provides a platform to share medical documents between providers who \\nare caring for the same patient so that there is continuity of treatment without duplication of effort.\\nBesides ease of access, this method of documentation decreases errors associated with poor\\npenmanship, lost pages, and misfiled records. It also provides documentation of health-care information\\nthat will be needed if legal issues arise. In addition, it is the basis for reimbursement of medical services.\\nThus, it is important that all information entered into the medical record be complete, current, correct,\\nand maintained in confidentiality. \\nCurrently, increasing numbers of physician offices, clinics, hospitals, and other medical settings are\\nproviding patients with access to their individual EMRs. In this way, the EMR is available instantly and\\nsecurely for patients and other authorized users.

Radiographic examination of June 14, 20xx, reveals the follow-\\ning: AP, lateral, and odontoid views of the cervical spine demonstrate some reversal of normal cervical\\ncurvature, as seen on lateral projection. There is some right lateral scoliosis of the cervical spine. The\\nvertebral bodies, however, appear to be well maintained in height; the intervertebral spaces are well\\nmaintained. The odontoid is visualized and appears to be intact. The atlantoaxial joint appears \\nsymmetrical.\\nImpression: Films of the cervical spine demonstrate some reversal of normal cervical curvature and a\\nminimal scoliosis, possibly secondary to muscle spasm, without evidence of recent bony disease or in-\\njury. AP and lateral films of the lumbar spine, with spots of the lumbosacral junction, demonstrate an\\napparent minimal spina bifida occulta of the first sacral segment. The vertebral bodies, however, are\\nwell maintained in height; the intervertebral spaces appear well maintained.\\nPathological Diagnosis: Right lateral scoliosis with some reversal of normal cervical curvature\\nIf you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.\\nSincerely yours,\\nAdrian Jones, MD\\nAdrian Jones, MD\\naj:bg\\n5867_Ch04_043-080  11/01/17  11:17 AM  Page 73'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 107}, page_content='Anatomy and Physiology\\nThe skin, also called the integument, is the largest organ in the body. Together with its acces-\\nsory organs (hair, nails, and glands), the skin makes up the integumentary system. This elab-\\norate system of distinct tissues includes glands that produce several types of secretions, nerves\\nthat transmit impulses, and blood vessels that help regulate body temperature. The skin covers\\nand protects all outer surfaces of the body and performs many vital functions, including the\\nsense of touch.\\nSkin\\nThe skin protects underlying structures from injury and provides sensory information to the brain.\\nBeneath the skin’s surface is an intricate network of nerve ﬁbers that register sensations of tem-\\nperature, pain, and pressure. Other important functions of the skin include protecting the body\\nagainst ultraviolet rays, regulating body temperature, and preventing dehydration. The skin also\\nacts as a reservoir for food and water. It also synthesizes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight.\\nThe skin consists of two distinct layers: the epidermis and the dermis. A subcutaneous layer of\\ntissue binds the skin to underlying structures. (See Fig. 5-1.)\\nEpidermis\\nThe outer layer of the skin, the (1) epidermis, is relatively thin over most areas but is thickest on\\nthe palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Although the epidermis is composed of several\\nsublayers called strata, the (2) stratum corneum and the (3) basal layer, which is the deepest\\nlayer, are of greatest importance.\\n82 CHAPTER 5 \\x81 Integumentary System\\nAnatomy and Physiology Key Terms\\nThis section introduces important terms, along with their definitions and pronunciations.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 108}, page_content='The stratum corneum is composed of dead, ﬂat cells that lack a blood supply and sensory re-\\nceptors. Its thickness is related to normal wear of the area it covers. The basal layer is the only\\nlayer of the epidermis that is composed of living cells where new cells are formed. As these cells\\nmove toward the stratum corneum to replace the cells that have been sloughed oﬀ, they die and\\nbecome ﬁlled with a hard protein material called keratin. The relatively waterproof characteristic\\nof keratin prevents body ﬂuids from evaporating and moisture from entering the body. The entire\\nprocess by which a cell forms in the basal layer, rises to the surface, becomes keratinized, and\\nsloughs oﬀ takes about 1 month.\\nIn the basal layer, special cells called melanocytes produce a black pigment called melanin.\\nMelanin provides a protective barrier from the damaging eﬀects of the sun’s ultraviolet radia-\\ntion, which can cause skin cancer. Moderate sun exposure increases the rate of melanin produc-\\ntion and results in a suntan. However, overexposure results in sunburn caused by melanin’s in-\\nability to absorb suﬃcient ultraviolet rays to prevent the burn.\\nDiﬀerences in skin color are attributed to the amount of melanin in each cell. Dark-skinned\\npeople produce large amounts of melanin and are less likely to have wrinkles or skin cancer. Pro-\\nduction of melanocytes is genetically regulated and, thus, inherited. Local accumulations of\\nmelanin are seen in pigmented moles and freckles. An absence of pigment in the skin, eyes, and\\nhair is most likely the result of an inherited inability to produce melanin. An individual who can-\\nnot produce melanin, known as an albino, has a marked deﬁciency of pigment in the eyes, hair,\\nand skin.\\nDermis\\nThe second layer of the skin, the (4) dermis, also called the corium, lies directly beneath the epi-\\ndermis. It is composed of living tissue and contains numerous capillaries, lymphatic vessels, and\\nAnatomy and Physiology 83\\n(1) Epidermis\\n(4) Dermis \\n(5) Subcutaneous\\n     tissue\\n(10) Papilla\\n(8) Hair shaft\\nSweat gland \\npore\\n(2) Stratum \\n     corneum\\n(3) Basal layer\\nTouch receptor\\n(7) Sebaceous \\n     (oil) gland\\n(9) Hair follicle\\nNerve (6) Sudoriferous\\n      (sweat) gland\\nAdipose tissue\\nArteriole Venule\\nFigure 5-1 Structure of the skin and subcutaneous tissue.\\n5867_Ch05_081-126  12/01/17  12:06 PM  Page 83'),\n",

Hair follicles, sebaceous (oil) glands, and sudoriferous (sweat) glands are also lo-\\ncated in the dermis.\\nThe (5) subcutaneous layer, also called the hypodermis, binds the dermis to underlying struc-\\ntures. It is composed primarily of loose connective tissue and adipose (fat) tissue interlaced with\\nblood vessels. The subcutaneous layer stores fats, insulates and cushions the body, and regulates\\ntemperature. The amount of fat in the subcutaneous layer varies with the region of the body and\\nsex, age, and nutritional state.\\nAccessory Organs of the Skin\\nThe accessory organs of the skin consist of integumentary glands, hair, and nails. The glands play\\nan important role in defending the body against disease and maintaining homeostasis, whereas\\nthe hair and nails have more limited functional roles.\\nGlands\\nTwo important glands located in the dermis produce secretions: The (6) sudoriferous (sweat)\\nglands produce sweat and the (7) sebaceous (oil) glands produce oil. These two glands are ex-\\nocrine glands because they secrete substances through ducts to an outer surface of the body rather\\nthan directly into the bloodstream.\\nThe sudoriferous glands secrete perspiration, or sweat, onto the surface of the skin through\\npores. Pores are most plentiful on the palms, soles, forehead, and axillae (armpits). The main\\nfunctions of the sudoriferous glands are to cool the body by evaporation, excrete waste products,\\nand moisten surface cells.\\nThe sebaceous glands are ﬁlled with cells, the centers of which contain fatty droplets. As these\\ncells disintegrate, they yield an oily secretion called sebum. The acidic nature of sebum helps de-\\nstroy harmful organisms on the skin, thus preventing infection. When ductules of the sebaceous\\nglands become blocked, acne may result. Congested sebum causes formation of pimples or white-\\nheads. If the sebum is dark, it forms blackheads. Sex hormones, particularly androgens, regulate\\nthe production and secretion of sebum. During adolescence, secretions increase; as the person\\nages, secretions diminish. The loss of sebum, which lubricates the skin, may be one of the reasons\\nfor the formation of wrinkles that accompanies old age. Sebaceous glands are present over the en-\\ntire body except on the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands. They are especially prevalent\\non the scalp and face; around such openings as the nose, mouth, external ear, and anus; and on\\nthe upper back.\\nHair\\nHair is found on nearly all parts of the body except for the lips, nipples, palms of the hands, soles\\nof the feet, and parts of the external genitalia. The visible part of the hair is the (8) hair shaft; the\\npart that is embedded in the dermis is the hair root. The root, together with its coverings, forms\\nthe (9) hair follicle. At the bottom of the follicle is a loop of capillaries enclosed in a covering\\ncalled the (10) papilla. The cluster of epithelial cells lying over the papilla reproduces and is re-\\nsponsible for the eventual formation of the hair shaft. As long as these cells remain alive, hair will\\nregenerate even if it is cut, plucked, or otherwise removed. Alopecia (baldness) occurs when the\\nhairs of the scalp are not replaced because of death of the papillae (singular, papilla).\\nLike skin color, hair color is related to the amount of pigment produced by epidermal\\nmelanocytes. Melanocytes are found at the base of the hair follicle. Melanin ranges in color from\\nyellow to reddish brown to black. Varying amounts of melanin produce hair ranging in color from\\nblond to brunette to black; the more abundant the melanin, the darker the hair. Heredity and ag-\\ning aﬀect melanin levels. A decrease or an absence of melanin causes loss of hair color.\\nNails\\nNails protect the tips of the ﬁngers and toes from bruises and injuries. (See Fig. 5-2.) Each nail\\nis formed in the (1) nail root and is composed of keratinized, stratiﬁed, squamous epithelial cells\\nproducing a very tough covering. As the nail grows, it stays attached and slides forward over the\\nlayer of epithelium called the (2) nailbed. This epithelial layer is continuous with the epithelium\\n84 CHAPTER 5 \\x81 Integumentary System\\n5867_Ch05_081-126  12/01/17  12:06 PM  Page 84'),\n",

Although burns generally occur on the skin, they can also aﬀect the respiratory and di-\\ngestive tract linings. Burns that have a local eﬀect are not as serious as those that have a systemic\\neﬀect. Systemic eﬀects are life-threatening and may include dehydration, shock, and infection.\\nBurns are usually classiﬁed as ﬁrst-, second-, or third-degree burns. The extent of injury and\\ndegree of severity determine a burn’s classiﬁcation. First-degree (superﬁcial) burns are the least\\nserious type of burn because they injure only the top layers of the skin, the epidermis. These burns\\nare most commonly caused by brief contact with dry or moist heat (thermal burn), spending too\\nmuch time in the sun (sunburn), or exposure to chemicals (chemical burn). Injury is restricted\\nto local eﬀects, such as skin redness (erythema) and acute sensitivity to such sensory stimuli as\\ntouch, heat, or cold (hyperesthesia). Generally, blisters do not form, and the burn heals without\\nscar formation. Second-degree (partial-thickness) burns are deep burns that damage the epider-\\nmis and part of the dermis. These burns may be caused by contact with ﬂames, hot liquids, or\\nchemicals. Symptoms mimic those of ﬁrst-degree burns, but ﬂuid-ﬁlled blisters (vesicles or \\nbullae) form, and the burn may heal with little or no scarring. (See Fig. 5-4.)\\nIn third-degree (full-thickness) burns, the epidermis and dermis are destroyed, and some of the\\nunderlying connective tissue is damaged, leaving the skin waxy and charred with insensitivity to\\ntouch. The underlying bones, muscles, and tendons may also be damaged. These burns may be caused\\nby corrosive chemicals, ﬂames, electricity, or extremely hot objects; immersion of the body in ex-\\ntremely hot water; or clothing that catches ﬁre. Because of the extensiveness of tissue destruction, ul-\\ncerating wounds develop, and the body attempts to heal itself by forming scar tissue. Skin grafting\\n(dermatoplasty) is commonly required to protect the underlying tissue and assist in recovery.\\nA formula for estimating the percentage of adult body surface area aﬀected by burns is to apply\\nthe Rule of Nines. This method assigns values of 9% or 18% of surface area to speciﬁc regions.\\nThe formula is modiﬁed in infants and children because of the proportionally larger head size.\\n(See Fig. 5-5.) To determine treatment, it is important to know the amount of the burned surface\\narea because the patient requires intravenous (IV) ﬂuids for hydration to replace ﬂuids lost from\\ntissue damage.\\nDisease Focus 93\\nFigure 5-4 Second-degree burn of the hand.

Benign\\nneoplasms are noncancerous growths composed of the same type of cells as the tissue in which\\nthey are growing. They harm the individual only insofar as they place pressure on or interfere with\\nthe functioning of surrounding structures. If the benign neoplasm remains small, it does not com-\\nmonly require removal. When the tumor enlarges, causes pain, or interferes with other organs or\\nstructures, excision is necessary. Malignant neoplasms, also called cancer, are composed of cells\\nthat tend to become invasive and spread to remote regions of the body (metastasis). Once the\\nmalignant cells from the primary tumor invade surrounding tissues, they tend to enter blood and\\nlymph vessels and travel to remote regions of the body to form secondary tumor sites. If left un-\\ntreated, cancer tends to be progressive and generally fatal.\\nCancer treatment includes surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation therapy. Im-\\nmunotherapy,also called biotherapy,is a newer treatment that stimulates the body’s own immune\\ndefenses to ﬁght tumor cells.

The greater the diﬀerence between the normal tissue and the biop-\\nsied tissue, the more serious is the grade of cancer. Pathologists commonly describe these changes\\nusing four grades of severity based on the microscopic appearance of the cells. (See Table 5-1.) A\\ngrade I tumor shows cells that closely resemble the tissue of origin. In other words, most of the\\ncells are well diﬀerentiated and able to carry on the function of the tissue. A patient with a grade\\nI tumor has a good prognosis for full recovery. On the other hand, a patient with a grade IV tu-\\nmor shows cells that are very poorly diﬀerentiated and grow rapidly. These cells spread to sur-\\nrounding tissue, revert back to their primitive state (anaplasia), and are incapable of carrying on\\nthe normal function of the tissue. A patient with a grade IV tumor has the poorest prognosis.\\nTumor Staging\\nThe most common system used for staging tumors is the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) sys-\\ntem. It is an international system that allows comparison of statistics among cancer centers.\\nThe TNM staging system classifies solid tumors by size and degree of spread according to three\\nbasic criteria:\\n• T—size and invasiveness of the primary tumor\\n• N—area lymph nodes involved\\n• M—invasiveness (metastasis) of the primary tumor\\nNumbers are used to indicate size or spread of the tumor. The higher the number, the greater\\nis the extent or spread of the malignancy. For example, T2 designates a small tumor; M0 desig-\\nnates no evidence of metastasis. (See Table 5-2.) As with grading, staging provides valuable \\ninformation to guide treatment plans.\\nBasal Cell Carcinoma\\nBasal cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer, is a malignancy of the basal layer of\\nthe epidermis, or hair follicles. This type of cancer is commonly caused by overexposure to sun-\\nlight. The tumors are locally invasive but rarely metastasize. (See Fig. 5-6.)

It is an invasive tumor with potential for metastasis and occurs most commonly\\nin fair-skinned white men over age 60. (See Fig. 5-7.) Repeated overexposure to the sun’s ultra-\\nviolet rays greatly increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma. Other predisposing factors asso-\\nciated with this type of cancer include radiation therapy; chronic skin irritation and inﬂammation;\\nexposure to cancer-causing agents (carcinogens), including tar and oil; hereditary diseases (such\\nas xeroderma pigmentosum and albinism); and the presence of premalignant lesions (such as ac-\\ntinic keratosis or Bowen disease).\\nThere are two types of squamous cell carcinoma: those that are conﬁned to the original site (in\\nsitu) and those that penetrate the surrounding tissue (invasive). Depending on the location, size,\\nshape, degree of invasion, and condition of the underlying tissue, treatment is removal by surgical\\nexcision, cryotherapy, radiotherapy, or electrodesiccation and curettage. A combination of these\\ntreatment methods may be required for a deeply invasive tumor.\\nMalignant Melanoma\\nMalignant melanoma, as the name implies, is a malignant growth of melanocytes. (See Fig. 5-8.)\\nThis tumor is highly metastatic, with a higher mortality rate than basal or squamous cell carcino-\\nmas. It is the most lethal of the skin cancers and can metastasize extensively to the liver, lungs, or\\nbrain.\\nSeveral factors may inﬂuence the development of melanoma, but persons at greatest risk have\\nfair complexions, blue eyes, red or blond hair, and freckles. Excessive exposure to sunlight and se-\\nvere sunburn during childhood are believed to increase the risk of melanoma in later life. Avoid-\\ning the sun and using sunscreen have proved eﬀective in preventing the disease.\\nMelanomas are diagnosed by biopsy and histological examination.

The GI tract, extending from the\\nmouth to the anus, varies in size and structure in several distinct regions.\\nFood passing along the GI tract is mixed with digestive enzymes and broken down into nutri-\\nent molecules, which are absorbed in the bloodstream. Undigested waste materials not absorbed\\nby the blood are then eliminated from the body through defecation. Included in the digestive sys-\\ntem are the accessory organs of digestion: the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. The process of \\ndigestion breaks down food into nutrients to nourish the body.

(See Fig. 6-2, page 130.) The mouth, also known\\nas the (1) oral cavity, is a receptacle for food. It is formed by the cheeks (bucca), lips, teeth,\\ntongue, and hard and soft palates. Located around the oral cavity are three pairs of salivary glands\\nthat secrete saliva. Saliva contains important digestive enzymes that help begin the chemical\\nbreakdown of food. In the mouth, food is broken down mechanically (by the teeth) and chemi-\\ncally (by saliva) and then formed into a bolus.\\n5867_Ch06_127-178  12/01/17  12:11 PM  Page 128'),\n",

Teeth are covered by a\\nhard enamel, giving them a smooth, white appearance. Beneath the enamel is dentin, the main\\nstructure of the tooth. The innermost part of the tooth is the pulp, which contains nerves and\\nblood vessels. The teeth are embedded in pink, ﬂeshy tissue known as gums (gingiva).\\nTongue\\nThe (3) tongue assists in the chewing process by manipulating the bolus of food during chewing\\nand moving it to the back of the mouth for swallowing (deglutition). The tongue also aids in\\nspeech production and taste. Rough projections on the surface of the tongue called papillae con-\\ntain taste buds. The four basic taste sensations registered by chemical stimulation of the taste buds\\nare sweet, sour, salty, and bitter. All other taste perceptions are combinations of these four basic\\nﬂavors. In addition, the sense of taste is intricately linked with the sense of smell, making taste\\nperception very complex.\\nHard and Soft Palates\\nThe two structures forming the roof of the mouth are the (4) hard palate (anterior portion) and\\nthe (5) soft palate (posterior portion). The soft palate, which forms a partition between the\\nmouth and the nasopharynx, is continuous with the hard palate. The entire oral cavity, like the\\nrest of the GI tract, is lined with mucous membranes.\\nPharynx, Esophagus, and Stomach\\nAs the tongue pushes the bolus into the (6) pharynx (throat), it is guided by the soft, ﬂeshy, \\nV-shaped structure called the (7) uvula. The funnel-shaped pharynx serves as a passageway to the\\nrespiratory and GI tracts and provides a resonating chamber for speech sounds. The lowest por-\\ntion of the pharynx divides into two tubes: one that leads to the lungs, called the (8) trachea,\\nand one that leads to the stomach, called the (9) esophagus.

At all other times, the epiglottis remains upright, allowing air to freely pass through the \\nrespiratory structures.\\nThe stomach,a saclike structure located in the left upper quadrant (LUQ) of the abdominal cavity,\\nserves as a food reservoir that continues mechanical and chemical digestion. (See Fig. 6-3.) The stom-\\nach extends from the (1) esophagus to the ﬁrst part of the small intestine, the (2) duodenum. The\\nterminal portion of the esophagus, the (3) lower esophageal (cardiac) sphincter, is composed of\\nmuscle ﬁbers that constrict once food has passed into the stomach. It prevents the stomach contents\\nfrom regurgitating back into the esophagus. The (4) body of the stomach, the large central portion,\\ntogether with the (5) fundus, the upper portion, are mainly storage areas. Most digestion takes place\\nin the funnel-shaped terminal portion, the (6) pylorus. The interior lining of the stomach is com-\\nposed of mucous membranes and contains numerous macroscopic longitudinal folds called (7) rugae\\nthat gradually unfold as the stomach ﬁlls. Located within the rugae, digestive glands produce hy-\\ndrochloric acid (HCl) and enzymes. Secretions from these glands coupled with the mechanical\\nchurning of the stomach turn the bolus into a semiliquid form called chyme that slowly leaves the\\nstomach through the (8) pyloric sphincter to enter the duodenum. This sphincter regulates the\\nspeed and movement of chyme into the small intestine and prohibits backﬂow. Food is propelled\\nthrough the entire GI tract by coordinated, rhythmic muscle contractions called peristalsis.\\nSmall Intestine\\nThe small intestine is a coiled tube approximately 20 feet long that begins at the pyloric sphincter\\nand ends at the large intestine. (See Fig. 6-4, page 132.) It consists of three parts:\\n• (1) duodenum, the uppermost segment, which is approximately 10 inches long\\n• (2) jejunum, which is approximately 8 feet long\\n• (3) ileum, which is approximately 12 feet long\\nDigestion is completed in the small intestine with the help of additional enzymes and secretions\\nfrom the (4) pancreas and (5) liver.

If it becomes infected and inﬂamed, the\\nappendix can cause considerable pain and must be surgically removed (appendectomy). The cecum\\nmerges as it becomes the ﬁrst part of the colon. The main functions of the colon are to absorb water\\nand minerals and eliminate undigested material.

It performs endocrine and exocrine functions. As an endocrine gland, the pancreas\\nsecretes insulin directly into the bloodstream to maintain normal blood glucose levels. For a com-\\nprehensive discussion of the endocrine function of the pancreas, review Chapter 13. As an exocrine\\ngland, the pancreas produces digestive enzymes that pass into the duodenum through the (3) pan-\\ncreatic duct.The pancreatic duct extends along the pancreas and, together with the (4) hepatic duct\\nfrom the liver, enters the (5) duodenum. The pancreas produces enzymes, such as trypsin, which \\ndigests proteins; amylase, which digests starch; and lipase, which digests triglycerides. These pass\\ninto the duodenum through the pancreatic duct.\\nGallbladder\\nThe (6) gallbladder, a saclike structure on the inferior surface of the liver, serves as a storage area\\nfor bile, which is produced by the liver. When bile is needed for digestion, the gallbladder releases\\nit into the duodenum through the (7) common bile duct. Bile is also drained from the liver\\nthrough the (8) right hepatic duct and the (9) left hepatic duct. These two structures eventually\\nform the hepatic duct. The (10) cystic duct of the gallbladder merges with the hepatic duct to\\nform the common bile duct, which leads into the duodenum. Bile production is stimulated by\\nhormone secretions, which are produced in the duodenum as soon as food enters the small intes-\\ntine.

Clinical signs, such as jaundice and edema,\\nmay indicate a hepatic disorder. Severe infection, drug toxicity, and changes in ﬂuid and electrolyte\\nbalance can cause behavioral abnormalities. Disorders of the GI tract or any of the accessory organs\\n(liver, gallbladder, and pancreas) may result in far-reaching metabolic or systemic problems that \\ncan eventually threaten life itself. Assessment of a suspected digestive disorder includes a thorough\\nhistory and physical examination. A range of diagnostic tests can assist in identifying abnormalities\\nof the GI tract, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas.\\nFor diagnosis, treatment, and management of digestive disorders, the medical services of a spe-\\ncialist may be warranted. Gastroenterology is the branch of medicine concerned with digestive\\ndiseases. The physician who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of digestive disorders is\\nknown as a gastroenterologist. Gastroenterologists do not perform surgeries; however, under the\\nbroad classiﬁcation of surgery, they do perform such procedures as liver biopsy and endoscopic\\nexaminations.\\nPeptic Ulcer Disease (PUD)\\nAn ulcer is a circumscribed open sore on the skin or mucous membranes of the body. Peptic\\nulcers are one of the most common ulcer types that occur in the digestive system. They prima-\\nrily develop in the stomach and duodenum but may also occur to a lesser extent in the lower\\nesophagus. Ulcers are named by their location in the body: esophageal ulcer, gastric ulcer, or\\nduodenal ulcer. (See Fig. 6-6.)\\nA common cause of PUD is the erosion of the protective mucous membrane caused by infec-\\ntion with Helicobacter pylori bacteria. As the mucous membrane erodes, it exposes the tissue be-\\nneath to the strong acids and digestive enzymes of the stomach, and eventually, an ulcer forms.\\nSome individuals have more rapid gastric emptying, which—combined with hypersecretion of\\nacid—creates a large amount of acid moving into the duodenum. As a result, peptic ulcers occur\\nmore commonly in the duodenum.\\n142 CHAPTER 6 \\x81 Digestive System\\nMedical Word Elements—cont’d\\nElement Meaning Word Analysis and Meaning\\nPrefixes\\ndia-\\nperi-\\nsub-\\nthrough, \\nacross\\naround\\nunder, below\\ndia/rrhea (dī-ă-RĒ-ă):\\n-rrhea: discharge, flow\\nDiarrhea is a discharge or flow of fluid fecal matter through the bowel.\\nperi/odont/itis (p˘er-ē-ō-d˘on-TĪ-t˘ ıs):\\nodont-: tooth\\n-itis: inflammation\\nsub/lingu/al (s˘ub-L˘IN-gwăl):\\nlingu: tongue\\n-al: pertaining to\\nVisit the Medical Terminology Systems online resource center at DavisPlus for an\\naudio exercise using the terms in this table.

Treatment\\nincludes antibiotics to destroy H. pylori and antacids to reduce stomach acids and allow the ulcer\\nto heal. If left untreated, mucosal destruction produces a hole (perforation) in the wall lining,\\nwith resultant bleeding from the damaged area. At worst, the hole penetrates the entire wall,\\nand the gastric contents leak into the abdominal cavity, possibly leading to inﬂammation of the\\nperitoneum (peritonitis).\\nHernia\\nA hernia is a protrusion of any organ, tissue, or structure through the wall of the cavity in which\\nit is naturally contained. (See Fig. 6-7, page 144.) In general, though, the term is applied to pro-\\ntrusions of abdominal organs (viscera) through the abdominal wall.\\nAn (1) inguinal hernia develops in the groin where the abdominal folds of flesh meet the\\nthighs. In the initial stages, it may be hardly noticeable and appears as a soft lump under \\nthe skin, no larger than a marble. In the early stages, an inguinal hernia is usually reducible;\\nthat is, it can be pushed gently back into its normal place. With this type of hernia, pain may\\nbe minimal. As time passes, the pressure of the abdomen against the weak abdominal wall\\nmay increase the size of the opening and the size of the hernia lump. If the blood supply to\\nthe hernia is cut off because of pressure, a (2) strangulated hernia may develop, leading to\\nnecrosis with gangrene. An (3) umbilical hernia is a protrusion of part of the intestine at the\\nnavel. It occurs more commonly in obese women and among those who have had several preg-\\nnancies. Hernias also occur in newborn infants (congenital) or during early childhood. If the\\ndefect has not corrected itself by age 2, the deformity can be surgically corrected. Treatment\\nconsists of surgical repair of the hernia (hernioplasty) with suture of the abdominal wall\\n(herniorrhaphy).\\nDisease Focus 143\\nPeptic Ulcers\\nEsophagus Esophageal\\nulcer\\nStomach\\nDuodenum\\nDuodenal ulcer\\nGastric ulcer\\nFigure 6-6 Peptic ulcers.\\n5867_Ch06_127-178  12/01/17  12:11 PM  Page 143'),\n",

Two forms of this type include (4) diaphragmatic hernia, a congenital disorder, and\\n(5) hiatal hernia, in which the lower part of the esophagus and the top of the stomach slide\\nthrough an opening (hiatus) in the diaphragm into the thorax. With a hiatal hernia, stomach acid\\nbacks up into the esophagus, causing heartburn, chest pain, and swallowing diﬃculty. Although\\nmany hiatal hernias are asymptomatic, if the disease continues for a prolonged period, it may\\ncause gastroesophageal reﬂux disease (GERD).\\nHepatitis\\nHepatitis is an inﬂammatory condition of the liver. The usual causes include exposure to toxic\\nsubstances, especially alcohol; obstructions in the bile ducts; metabolic diseases; autoimmune dis-\\neases; and bacterial or viral infections. A growing public health concern is the increasing inci-\\ndence of viral hepatitis. Even though its mortality rate is low, the disease is easily transmitted and\\ncan cause signiﬁcant morbidity and prolonged loss of time from school or employment.\\nAlthough forms of hepatitis range from hepatitis A through hepatitis E, the three \\nmost common forms are hepatitis A (infectious hepatitis), hepatitis B (serum hepatitis), and\\nhepatitis C. The most common cause of hepatitis A is the ingestion of contaminated food,\\nwater, or milk. Hepatitis B and hepatitis C are usually transmitted by routes other than the\\nmouth (parenteral), such as from blood transfusions and sexual contact. Because of patient\\nexposure, health-care personnel are at increased risk for contracting hepatitis B, but a vaccine\\nthat provides immunity to hepatitis B is available. There is no vaccine available for hepatitis C.\\nPatients with hepatitis C may remain asymptomatic for years, or the disease may produce only\\nmild, flulike symptoms. Treatment for hepatitis includes antiviral drugs; however, there is no\\ncure. As the disease progresses, scarring of the liver may become so serious that liver trans-\\nplantation is the only recourse.\\nOne of the major symptoms of many liver disorders, including hepatitis and cirrhosis, is a \\nyellowing of the skin, mucous membranes, and sclerae of the eyes (jaundice or icterus). This con-\\ndition occurs because the liver is no longer able to remove bilirubin, a yellow compound formed\\nduring the destruction of erythrocytes. Jaundice may also result when the bile duct is blocked,\\ncausing bile to enter the bloodstream.\\n144 CHAPTER 6 \\x81 Digestive System\\n(5) Hiatal hernia\\n(4) Diaphragmatic \\n      hernia\\n(3) Umbilical \\n      hernia\\n(2) Strangulated \\n      hernia(1) Inguinal \\n      hernia\\nFigure 6-7 Common locations of hernias.\\n5867_Ch06_127-178  12/01/17  12:11 PM  Page 144'),\n",

These pockets occur most\\ncommonly in the sigmoid colon. They usually do not cause any problem unless they become \\ninﬂamed (diverticulitis). (See Fig. 6-8.) Symptoms of diverticulitis include pain, commonly in the\\nleft lower quadrant (LLQ) of the abdomen; extreme constipation (obstipation) or diarrhea; fever;\\nabdominal swelling; and occasional blood in bowel movements. Treatment for mild cases of diver-\\nticulitis includes rest, antibiotics, and changes in diet. Severe cases, however, may require surgical\\nintervention, such as excision of the aﬀected segment of intestine.\\nOncology\\nAlthough stomach cancer is rare in the United States, it is common in many parts of the world\\nwhere food preservation is problematic. It is an important medical problem because of its high\\nmortality rate. Men are more susceptible to stomach cancer than women. The neoplasm nearly\\nalways develops from the epithelial or mucosal lining of the stomach in the form of a cancerous\\nglandular tumor (gastric adenocarcinoma). Persistent indigestion is one of the important\\nwarning signs of stomach cancer. Other types of GI carcinomas include esophageal carcino-\\nmas, hepatocellular carcinomas, and pancreatic carcinomas.\\nColorectal cancer is one of the most common types of intestinal cancer in the United\\nStates. It originates in the epithelial lining of the colon or rectum and can occur anywhere in\\nthe large intestine.

Each episode lasted 2–4 hours. Eventually, she was diagnosed as having\\ncholecystitis with cholelithiasis and underwent cholecystectomy. Three to five large calcified stones\\nwere found.\\nPostoperative Course: Her postoperative course was uneventful until 4 months ago when she began\\nhaving continuous, deep, right-sided pain. This pain followed a crescendo pattern and peaked several\\nweeks ago, at a time when family stress was also at its climax. Since then, the pain has been following\\na decrescendo pattern. It does not cause any nausea or vomiting, does not trigger any urge to defecate,\\nand is not alleviated by passage of flatus. Her PMH is significant only for tonsillectomy, appendec-\\ntomy, and the cholecystectomy. Her PE findings indicated that there was no hepatomegaly or\\nsplenomegaly. The rectal examination confirmed normal sphincter tone and heme-negative stool.\\nImpression: Abdominal pain.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 207}, page_content='Olfactory neurons are receptors for the sense of smell. They are covered with a layer of mucus\\nand located deep in the nasal cavity, embedded among the epithelial cells lining the nasal tract.\\nBecause they are located higher in the nasal passage than air normally travels during breathing, a\\nperson must sniﬀ or inhale deeply to identify weak odors. Air passes from the nasal cavity to the\\nthroat (pharynx), a muscular tube that serves as a passageway for food and air. The pharynx con-\\nsists of three sections: the (2) nasopharynx, posterior to the nose; the (3) oropharynx, posterior\\nto the mouth; and the (4) laryngopharynx, superior to the larynx.\\nWithin the nasopharynx is a collection of lymphoid tissue known as (5) adenoids (pharyngeal\\ntonsils). The (6) palatine tonsils, more commonly known as tonsils, are located in the oropharynx.\\nThey protect the opening to the respiratory tract from microscopic organisms that may attempt\\nentry by this route. The (7) larynx (voice box) contains the structures that make vocal sounds pos-\\nsible. A leaf-shaped structure on top of the larynx, the (8) epiglottis, seals oﬀ the air passage to\\nthe lungs during swallowing. This function ensures that food or liquids do not obstruct the ﬂow\\nof air to the lungs. The larynx is a short passage that joins the pharynx with the (9) trachea (wind-\\npipe). The trachea is composed of smooth muscle embedded with C-shaped rings of cartilage,\\nwhich provide rigidity to keep the air passage open.\\nLower Respiratory Tract\\nThe trachea divides into two branches called (10) bronchi (singular, bronchus). One branch leads\\nto the (11) right lung and the other to the (12) left lung. The inner walls of the trachea and\\nbronchi are composed of mucous membrane (mucosa) embedded with cilia. This membrane\\ntraps incoming particles, and the cilia move the entrapped material upward into the pharynx,\\nwhere it is expelled by coughing, sneezing, or swallowing. Like the trachea, bronchi contain \\nC-shaped rings of cartilage.\\nEach bronchus divides into smaller and smaller branches, eventually forming (13) bronchi-\\noles. At the end of the bronchioles are tiny air sacs called (14) alveoli (singular, alveolus). An\\nalveolus resembles a small balloon because it expands and contracts with inﬂow and outﬂow of\\nair. The (15) pulmonary capillaries lie next to the thin tissue membranes of the alveoli. Carbon\\ndioxide diffuses from the blood within the pulmonary capillaries and enters the alveolar spaces,\\nand O2 from the alveoli diﬀuses into the blood. After the exchange of gases, freshly oxygenated\\nblood returns to the heart. Oxygen is now ready for delivery to all body tissues.\\nThe lungs are divided into lobes: three lobes in the right lung and two lobes in the left lung.\\nThe space between the right and left lungs is called the (16) mediastinum. It contains the heart,\\naorta, esophagus, and bronchi. A serous membrane, the pleura, covers the lobes of the lungs and\\nfolds over to line the walls of the thoracic cavity. The membrane lying closest to the lung is the\\n(17) visceral pleura; the membrane that lines the thoracic cavity is the (18) parietal pleura. The\\nspace between these two membranes is the (19) pleural cavity. It contains a small amount of \\nlubricating ﬂuid, which permits the visceral pleura to glide smoothly over the parietal pleura \\nduring breathing.\\nVentilation depends on a pressure diﬀerential between the atmosphere and chest cavity. A\\nlarge muscular partition, the (20) diaphragm, lies between the chest and abdominal cavities. The\\ndiaphragm assists in changing the volume of the thoracic cavity to produce the needed pressure\\ndiﬀerential for ventilation. When the diaphragm contracts, it partially descends into the abdom-\\ninal cavity, thus decreasing the pressure within the chest and drawing air into the lungs (inspira-\\ntion). When the diaphragm relaxes, it slowly reenters the thoracic cavity, thus increasing the\\npressure within the chest. As pressure increases, air leaves the lungs (expiration). The intercostal\\nmuscles assist the diaphragm in changing the volume of the thoracic cavity by elevating and low-\\nering the rib cage.

Many disorders of the respiratory system, including bronchitis and em-\\nphysema, begin as an acute problem but become chronic over time. Chronic respiratory diseases\\nare diﬃcult to treat. Their damaging eﬀects are often irreversible.\\nFor diagnosis, treatment, and management of respiratory disorders, the medical services of a\\nspecialist may be warranted. Pulmonology is the medical specialty concerned with disorders of\\nthe respiratory system. The physician who treats these disorders is called a pulmonologist.\\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease\\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes respiratory disorders that produce a\\nchronic partial obstruction of the air passages. Because of its chronic nature, the disease leads to\\nlimited airﬂow into and out of the lungs, with increased diﬃculty in breathing (dyspnea). COPD\\nis insidious and is commonly ﬁrst diagnosed after the patient has already lost some lung capacity.\\nIt is possible to have early stages of COPD without knowing it. (See Table 7-1.) The three major\\ndisorders of COPD are asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. (See Fig. 7-3.)\\nAsthma\\nAsthma produces spasms in the bronchial passages (bronchospasms) that may be sudden and\\nviolent (paroxysmal), causing dyspnea. Asthma is caused by exposure to allergens or irritants.\\nOther causes include stress, cold, and exercise. During recovery, coughing episodes produce\\nlarge amounts of mucus (productive cough). Over time, the epithelium of the bronchial pas-\\nsages thickens, breathing becomes more difficult, and flare-ups (exacerbations) occur more\\nfrequently. Treatment includes agents that loosen and break down mucus (mucolytics) and\\nmedications that expand the bronchi (bronchodilators) by relaxing their smooth muscles.\\nMost cases of asthma can be treated effectively. However, when treatment does not reverse\\nbronchospasm, a life-threatening condition called status asthmaticus can occur, requiring\\nhospitalization.\\n190 CHAPTER 7 \\x81 Respiratory System\\nTable 7-1 Stages of COPD\\nThis table lists the levels of severity of COPD and describes their characteristics.\\nSeverity Level Description\\nAt risk, mild\\nModerate\\nSevere\\nVery severe\\n• Minor difficulty with airflow\\n• Possible presence of chronic cough with sputum production\\n• Patient possibly unaware of disease\\n• Apparent limitation in airflow\\n• Possible shortness of breath\\n• Patient possibly seeking medical intervention at this level\\n• Inadequate airflow\\n• Increase in shortness of breath with activity\\n• Patient experiencing diminished quality of life\\n• Severe airflow limitations\\n• Significant impairment in quality of life\\n• Possible life-threatening exacerbations\\n• Possible development of complications, such as respiratory or heart failure\\n5867_Ch07_179-220  11/01/17  11:23 AM  Page 190'),\n",

The alveoli expand (dilate) but\\nare unable to contract to their original size, making it diﬃcult to exhale. The air that remains\\ntrapped in the chest results in a characteristic “barrel-chested” appearance.

For elderly\\npatients, especially those who are hospitalized with other health issues, a pleural ﬂuid culture and\\ncomputed tomography (CT) scan aid in determining a diagnosis.\\nAcute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a condition in which the lungs no longer func-\\ntion eﬀectively, threatening the life of the patient. It usually occurs as a result of very serious lung\\nconditions, such as trauma, severe pneumonia, and other major infections that aﬀect the entire\\nbody (systemic infections) or blood (sepsis). In ARDS, the alveoli ﬁll with ﬂuid (edema) caused\\nby inﬂammation and then collapse, making oxygen exchange impossible. Mechanical ventilation\\nis commonly required to save the life of the patient.\\nNeonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) is a form of respiratory distress syndrome\\nseen in preterm infants or infants born to diabetic mothers. It is caused by insuﬃcient surfactant,\\na phospholipid substance that helps keep alveoli open. With insuﬃcient surfactant, the alveoli\\ncollapse, and breathing becomes labored. Clinical signs may include blueness (cyanosis) of the\\nextremities. Flaring of the nostrils (nares), rapid breathing (tachypnea), and a characteristic\\ngrunt audible during exhalation are signs of this disorder. Radiography shows a membrane that\\nhas a ground-glass appearance (hyaline membrane), bilateral decrease in lung volume, and ﬂuid\\nin the alveoli (alveolar consolidation). Although severe cases of hyaline membrane disease\\n(HMD) result in death, some forms of therapy are eﬀective.\\nOncology\\nLung cancer, also called bronchogenic carcinoma, is a malignancy that arises from the epithe-\\nlium of the bronchial tree. As masses form, they block air passages and alveoli. Within a short\\ntime, they spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body, usually lymph nodes, liver, bones,\\nbrain, and kidneys. Cigarette smoking causes most lung cancers. High levels of pollution, radia-\\ntion, and asbestos exposure may also increase risk.\\nVery few lung cancers are found in the early stages when the cure rate is high. Treatment depends\\non the type, stage, and general health of the patient and includes surgery, radiation, chemotherapy,\\nor a combination of these methods. The prognosis for patients with lung cancer is generally poor.\\n192 CHAPTER 7 \\x81 Respiratory System\\n5867_Ch07_179-220  11/01/17  11:23 AM  Page 192'),\n",

(See Fig. 8-1.) Each type of vessel diﬀers in structure, depending on its function.\\nArteries\\nArteries carry blood from the heart to all cells of the body. Because the pumping action of the\\nheart propels blood through the arteries, the walls of the arteries must be strong and ﬂexible\\nenough to withstand the surge of blood that results from each contraction.\\nThe walls of large arteries have three layers to provide toughness and elasticity. The (4) tunica\\nexterna is the outer coat, composed of connective tissue that provides strength and ﬂexibility. The\\nAnatomy and Physiology\\nThe cardiovascular (CV) system is composed of the heart and blood vessels. The heart is a hollow,\\nmuscular organ lying in the mediastinum, the center of the thoracic cavity between the lungs. The\\npumping action of the heart propels blood that contains oxygen (O2), nutrients, and other vital\\nproducts from the heart to body cells through a vast network of blood vessels called arteries. Arter-\\nies branch into smaller vessels until they become microscopic vessels called capillaries. At the cap-\\nillary level, an exchange of products occurs between body cells and blood. Capillaries merge to form\\nlarger blood vessels called venules, which then combine to form veins, the vessels that return blood\\nto the heart to begin the cycle again. Millions of body cells rely on the CV system for their survival.\\nWhen it fails, life at the cellular level is not possible and, ultimately, death occurs.\\n222 CHAPTER 8 \\x81 Cardiovascular System\\nAnatomy and Physiology Key Terms\\nThis section introduces important terms, along with their definitions and pronunciations.

Because capillary walls are\\ncomposed of only a single layer of endothelial cells, they are very thin. This thinness enables the\\nexchange of water, respiratory gases, macromolecules, metabolites, and wastes between the blood\\nand the cells adjacent to the capillary bed. The vast number of capillaries branching from arterioles\\ncauses blood to ﬂow very slowly, providing suﬃcient time for exchange of essential substances.\\nBlood ﬂow through the capillary networks is slow and intermittent, rather than steady, and is\\nregulated by the precapillary sphincters. When tissues require more blood, these sphincters open;\\nwhen less blood is required, they close. Once the exchange of products is complete, blood enters\\nthe venous system for its return to the heart.\\nVeins\\nVeins return blood to the heart. They are formed from smaller vessels called (9) venules that \\ndevelop from the union of capillaries. Because the extensive network of capillaries absorbs the\\npropelling pressure exerted by the heart, veins use other methods to return blood to the heart, \\nincluding the following:\\n• skeletal muscle contraction\\n• gravity\\n• respiratory activity\\n• valves\\nThe (10) valves are small structures within veins that prevent the backﬂow of blood. Valves are\\nfound mainly in the extremities and are especially important for returning blood from the legs to\\nthe heart because blood must travel a long distance against the force of gravity to reach the heart\\nfrom the legs. Large veins, especially in the abdomen, contain smooth muscle that provides peri-\\nstalsis and helps propel blood toward the heart.\\nBlood carried in veins (except for the blood in the pulmonary veins) contains a low concentra-\\ntion of O2 and a correspondingly high concentration of carbon dioxide (CO 2). This blood takes\\non a characteristic purple color and is said to be deoxygenated. It continuously circulates from the\\nheart to the lungs so that CO2 can be exchanged for O2.\\nHeart\\nThe heart is a muscular pump that propels blood to the entire body through a closed vascular net-\\nwork. It allows a dual circulatory system: pulmonary circulation provided by the right side of the\\nheart and systemic circulation provided by the left side of the heart. Pulmonary circulation deliv-\\ners blood to the lungs, where CO2 is exchanged for O 2. Systemic circulation delivers blood to\\nbody tissues, where O2 is exchanged for CO2, a waste product that will be expelled by the lungs.\\nBoth systemic and pulmonary circulatory activities occur simultaneously. (See Fig. 8-2.)\\nThe heart is enclosed in a sac called the pericardium and is composed of three distinct layers:\\n• endocardium, a serous membrane that lines the four chambers of the heart and its valves\\nand is continuous with the endothelium of the arteries and veins\\n• myocardium, the muscular layer of the heart\\n• epicardium, the outermost layer of the heart.\\nThe heart is divided into four chambers. (See Fig. 8-3, page 226.) The two upper chambers, \\nthe (1) right atrium (RA) and (2) left atrium (LA), collect blood. The two lower chambers, the \\n(3) right ventricle (RV)and (4) left ventricle (LV),pump blood from the heart. The right ventricle\\npumps blood to the lungs (pulmonary circulation) for oxygenation, and the left ventricle pumps\\noxygenated blood to the entire body (systemic circulation).\\nDeoxygenated blood from the body returns to the right atrium by way of two large veins: the\\n(5) superior vena cava, which collects and carries blood from the upper body, and the (6) inferior\\nvena cava, which collects and carries blood from the lower body. From the right atrium, blood\\npasses through the (7) tricuspid valve, consisting of three leaflets, to the right ventricle.

Without being stimulated by external nerves, it has the ability to initiate\\nand propagate each heartbeat, thereby setting the basic pace for the cardiac rate. For this reason,\\nthe SA node is commonly known as the pacemaker of the heart. The cardiac rate may be altered\\nby impulses from the autonomic nervous system. Such an arrangement allows outside inﬂuences\\nto accelerate or decelerate heart rate. For example, the heart beats more quickly during physical\\nexertion and more slowly during rest. Each electrical impulse discharged by the SA node is trans-\\nmitted to the (2) atrioventricular (AV) node, causing the atria to contract. The AV node is \\nlocated at the base of the right atrium. From this point, a tract of conduction ﬁbers called the \\n(3) bundle of His (or AV bundle), composed of a right and left branch, relays the impulse to the\\n(4) Purkinje ﬁbers. These ﬁbers extend up the ventricle walls. The Purkinje ﬁbers transmit \\nthe impulse to the right and left ventricles, causing them to contract. Blood is now forced from\\nthe heart through the pulmonary artery and aorta. Thus, the sequence of the four structures \\nresponsible for conduction of a contraction impulse is as follows:\\nSA node → AV node → bundle of His → Purkinje ﬁbers\\nImpulse transmission through the conduction system generates weak electrical impulses on the\\nsurface of the body. These impulses can be recorded on graph paper by an instrument called an\\nelectrocardiograph.The needle deﬂection of the electrocardiograph produces waves or peaks\\ndesignated by the letters P, Q, R, S, and T, each of which is associated with a speciﬁc electrical\\nevent, as follows:\\n• The P wave is the depolarization (contraction) of the atria.\\n• The QRS complex is the depolarization (contraction) of the ventricles.\\n• The T wave, which appears a short time later, is the repolarization (recovery) of the ventricles.\\nBlood Pressure\\nBlood pressure (BP) is the force exerted by blood against the arterial walls during two phases of a\\nheartbeat: the contraction phase (systole) when the blood is forced out of the heart and the relax-\\nation phase (diastole) when the ventricles are ﬁlling with blood. Systole produces the maximum\\nforce; diastole, the weakest. A sphygmomanometer measures blood pressure, which you record as\\ntwo ﬁgures separated by a diagonal line. When recording a blood pressure reading, list systolic\\npressure ﬁrst, followed by diastolic pressure. For instance, a blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg\\nmeans a systolic pressure of 120 with a diastolic pressure of 80.\\nSeveral factors inﬂuence blood pressure:\\n• resistance of blood ﬂow in blood vessels\\n• pumping action of the heart\\n• viscosity of blood\\n• elasticity of arteries\\n• quantity of blood in the vascular system\\n228 CHAPTER 8 \\x81 Cardiovascular System\\n5867_Ch08_221-266  10/01/17  5:05 PM  Page 228'),\n",

Although some of the most serious cardiovascular diseases have few\\nsigns and symptoms, when they occur they may include chest pain, breathing diﬃculties, cardiac\\nirregularities, and loss of consciousness.\\nFor diagnosis, treatment, and management of cardiovascular disorders, the medical services of\\na cardiologist may be warranted. Cardiology is the medical specialty concerned with disorders of\\nthe cardiovascular system.\\nArteriosclerosis\\nArteriosclerosis is a progressive degenerative disease of arterial walls that causes them to become\\nthickened and brittle, restricting the ﬂow of blood to tissues and organs. Its most common cause\\nis the buildup of a plaquelike substance composed of cholesterol, lipids, and cellular debris\\n(atheroma) on the interior arterial wall. Over time, the atheroma hardens (atherosclerosis) and\\nincreases in size, causing the lumen of the artery to narrow. (See Fig. 8-6.) In some instances,\\nblood hemorrhages into the plaque and forms a clot (thrombus) that may break loose, travel\\nthrough the vascular system, and lodge in a more distal area of the artery. Arterial emboli that\\ncompletely block circulation cause localized tissue death (infarction) in the surrounding area. A\\npartial blocking of circulation causes localized tissue anemia (ischemia).\\nArteries usually aﬀected by arteriosclerosis include the coronary, carotid, cerebral, and femoral\\narteries and the aorta. Depending on the artery involved, signs and symptoms vary. Arterioscle-\\nrosis in the coronary arteries causes chest pain and tightness (angina), commonly with excessive\\nsweating (diaphoresis). Arteriosclerosis in the carotid and cerebral arteries causes weakness or\\nparalysis on one side of the body (hemiplegia), blurred vision, and confusion. Arteriosclerosis in\\nthe femoral arteries causes muscle pain (myalgia) in calves, thighs, and feet.\\nMajor risk factors for developing arteriosclerosis include an elevated level of fatty substances in\\nthe blood (hyperlipidemia), age, family history, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes. Treatment\\nfor arteriosclerosis varies depending on the location and symptoms. Drugs that slow down or re-\\nverse fat buildup (statins) in arteries, those that control blood pressure (antihypertensives), and\\nthose that reduce thrombus formation (anticoagulants) are helpful. Surgical treatments include\\nrepairing the aﬀected vessels (angioplasty) and surgical removal of fatty deposits from the inside\\nof the artery (endarterectomy). Physicians commonly use endarterectomy to treat carotid artery\\ndisease, peripheral artery disease, and diseases of the renal artery and aortic arch.

It is usually caused\\nby bacteria (infective endocarditis) that have entered the bloodstream from infections in remote\\nregions of the body (gut, skin, mouth) and have lodged on damaged endocardial tissue or abnor-\\nmal valves. Once established in the heart, bacteria and other cellular material form clumps \\n(vegetations) on the valves, especially the mitral valve, causing it to narrow (mitral valve stenosis)\\nand impeding blood ﬂow to the ventricle or not to close properly (mitral valve insuﬃciency),\\ncommonly causing a backﬂow of blood into the atrium (regurgitation). (See Fig. 8-9.) Although\\nmedications may prove helpful, if heart failure develops as a result of damaged heart valves, sur-\\ngery to correct the damaged valves (valvuloplasty) may be the only treatment option. Whenever\\npossible, the original valve is repaired. When the damage is extensive, a mechanical device or one\\nmade of human or animal tissue (bioprosthetic) may be used.\\nCongenital valvular defects, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, mitral valve prolapse, and prosthetic\\nvalves are predisposing factors for developing endocarditis. Patients susceptible to endocarditis are\\ngiven antibiotic treatment to protect against infection before invasive procedures (prophylactic\\ntreatment).\\nVaricose Veins\\nVaricose veins are enlarged, engorged, twisted, superﬁcial veins. They develop when the valves\\nof the veins do not function properly (incompetent) and fail to prevent the backﬂow of blood.\\nVaricose veins may develop in almost any part of the body, including the esophagus (varices)\\nand rectum (hemorrhoids), but occur most commonly in the greater and lesser saphenous veins\\nof the lower legs. (See Fig. 8-10.) Varicose veins of the legs are not typically painful but may be\\nunsightly in appearance. Treatment of mild cases of varicose veins includes use of elastic stock-\\nings and rest periods, during which the legs are elevated.\\nHowever, if pain, open lesions, or inﬂammation of the vein (phlebitis) develops, treatment may\\nbe required.

The solid components of blood include the following:\\n• red blood cells (erythrocytes)\\n• white blood cells (leukocytes)\\n• platelets (thrombocytes) (See Fig. 9-1.)\\nThe body produces millions of blood cells every second to replace those that are destroyed or\\nworn out. In adults, blood cells form in the bone marrow of the skull, ribs, sternum, vertebrae,\\npelvis, and ends of the long bones of the arms and legs. The stem cells in the bone marrow give\\nrise to embryonic (blastic) forms of all blood cell types. In the embryonic stages, monocytes and\\nlymphocytes migrate to the lymphatic system for maturation and specialization. All other embry-\\nonic cells remain in the bone marrow to complete their development. Once blood cells mature,\\nthey enter the circulatory system. The development of blood cells into their mature forms is called\\nhematopoiesis or hemopoiesis.

During RBC development (erythropoiesis),\\nthey decrease in size and, just before reaching maturity, extrude their nuclei. They also develop a\\nspecialized iron-containing compound called hemoglobin (Hb, Hgb) that gives them their red\\ncolor. Hemoglobin carries oxygen to body tissues and exchanges it for carbon dioxide. When \\nmature, RBCs are shaped like biconcave disks of approximately the same size and hemoglobin\\nconcentration.\\nRBCs live about 120 days and then rupture, releasing hemoglobin and cell fragments. Hemo-\\nglobin breaks down into an iron compound called hemosiderin and several bile pigments.

Leukocytes\\nare crucial to the body’s defense against disease because of their ability to ingest and destroy bac-\\nteria and other foreign particles (phagocytosis). (See Fig. 9-3.) Unlike RBCs that remain in the\\nbloodstream, WBCs migrate through endothelial walls of capillaries and venules (diapedesis)\\nand enter tissue spaces. (See Fig. 9-4.)\\nThe two major types of leukocytes are classiﬁed according to the presence of granules in their\\ncytoplasm (granuloctyes) or absence of granules in their cytoplasm (agranulocytes) when ob-\\nserved microscopically. The granulocytic leukocytes are further classiﬁed as neutrophils,\\neosinophils, and basophils according to the staining reaction of their cytoplasmic granules during\\nthe preparation of blood smears for microscopic examination. The nuclei of mature granulocytes\\nare so deeply lobed, especially in neutrophils, that these cells appear to have multiple nuclei, pro-\\nviding an alternative naming classiﬁcation as polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs, polys).\\nThis nuclear characteristic is not typical of agranulocytes; consequently, agranulocytes are more\\ncommonly called mononuclear lymphocytes (MNLs).

Clotting factors in platelets and injured tissue release\\nthromboplastin,a substance that initiates clot formation. In the ﬁnal step of coagulation, \\nﬁbrinogen (a soluble blood protein) becomes insoluble and forms ﬁbrin strands that act as a \\nnet, entrapping blood cells. This jellylike mass of blood cells and ﬁbrin (thrombus, blood clot)\\nimpedes the ﬂow of blood (hemostasis) into the surrounding tissues.\\nPlasma\\nPlasma is the liquid portion of blood in which blood cells are suspended. Without blood cells,\\nplasma appears as a thin, almost colorless ﬂuid. It is composed of about 92% water and contains\\nsuch products as albumins, globulins, ﬁbrinogen (plasma proteins), clotting factors, gases, nutri-\\nents, salts, and hormones. A small amount of plasma continuously leaks from capillaries and de-\\nlivers these products to surrounding cells and exchanges them for waste material produced by\\nbody cells. This exchange makes cellular communication possible throughout the body. Blood\\nserum is a product of blood plasma formed when ﬁbrinogen and clotting factors are removed\\nfrom blood plasma.\\nBlood Types\\nHuman blood is divided into four types, A, B, AB, and O, based on the presence or absence of spe-\\nciﬁc antigens on the surface of RBCs. In each of these four blood types, the erythrocyte carries the\\nantigen that gives the name of the blood type. The plasma contains the opposite antibodies.

(See Fig. 9-6, page 274.) As whole blood\\ncirculates, a small amount of plasma seeps from (1) blood capillaries and enters surrounding \\ntissue.

However, the spleen also destroys old RBCs and\\nserves as a repository for healthy blood cells. The (9) thymus is located in the upper part of the\\nchest (mediastinum).

The (10) tonsils are masses of lymphatic \\ntissue located in the pharynx. They act as ﬁlters to protect the upper respiratory structures from\\ninvasion by pathogens.\\nImmune System\\nThere are two major immune defenses that protect the body against disease-causing organisms\\n(pathogens).The ﬁrst type of immune defense, called innate immunity, includes barriers de-\\nsigned to keep the pathogen from gaining entry into the body. The second type of immune de-\\nfense, called acquired immunity, identiﬁes and speciﬁcally destroys pathogens once they have\\ngained entry.\\nInnate Immunity\\nAlthough exposed to a vast number of harmful substances, most people suﬀer relatively few dis-\\neases throughout their lifetime. Numerous body defenses called immunity work together to pro-\\ntect against disease. One type of immunity begins functioning at birth or immediately afterward.\\nBecause it is present at the very beginning of life, it is called the innate immune system. It pro-\\nvides protective barriers to the entry of pathogens into the body and stops their spread should\\nthey successfully overcome the barriers. This system does not diﬀerentiate the various types of\\npathogens and is always ready to defend the body, no matter the type or nature of the pathogen.\\nAs such, the innate immune system is also considered nonspeciﬁc. The innate immune system\\nprovides two types of barriers:\\n• ﬁrst-line barriers that keep pathogens from entering the body, including the skin and \\nmucous membranes, tears, saliva, and gastric secretions\\n• second-line barriers that stop the spread of pathogens once they have gained entry, \\nincluding phagocytic cells, natural killer cells, and inﬂammation\\nAcquired Immunity\\nAcquired or adaptive immunity develops only after birth in an immunocompetent individual and\\nis a lifelong monitoring system. During each encounter with an antigen, the acquired immune \\nsystem produces unique cells and processes that destroy that particular antigen. The method of \\ndestroying the antigen is “custom made” for each speciﬁc antigenic encounter. As such, the \\nacquired immune system is considered speciﬁc. The white blood cells chieﬂy responsible for the\\nacquired immune response are monocytes and lymphocytes\\nMonocytes\\nAfter a brief stay in the vascular system, monocytes enter tissue spaces and become highly phago-\\ncytic macrophages. In this form, the macrophage ingests pathogens and other harmful substances.\\nThe macrophage processes them in such a way that their unique antigenic properties are preserved\\nand then displayed on the surface of the macrophage. This alerts the immune system to the pres-\\nence of a pathogen. As such, the macrophage is now considered an antigen-presenting cell\\n(APC). Dendritic cells, specialized macrophages, also have the ability to act as APCs. APCs,\\narmed with the antigenic property of the pathogen displayed on their surface, await an encounter\\nby an immune cell capable of responding to the unique antigen. At this encounter, the acquired\\nimmune system begins the operations required for the systematic destruction of the antigen.\\nLymphocytes\\nTwo types of lymphocytes, B cells (B lymphocytes) and T cells (T lymphocytes), are the active\\ncells of the acquired immune response.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 307}, page_content='Disease Focus\\nAnemias, leukemias, and coagulation disorders typically share common signs and symptoms that\\ninclude paleness, weakness, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations. Lymphatic disorders are\\ncommonly associated with edema and lymphadenopathy. Immune disorders include abnormally\\nheightened immune responses (hypersensitivities), depressed responses ( immunodeﬁciencies,\\nor immune deﬁciencies ), and responses where the immune system fails to recognize its own \\ntissue (autoimmunity).\\nFor diagnosis, treatment, and management of diseases that aﬀect blood and blood-forming \\norgans, the medical services of a specialist may be warranted. Hematology is the branch of med-\\nicine that studies blood cells, blood-clotting mechanisms, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. The\\nphysician who specializes in this branch of medicine is called a hematologist. Allergy and im-\\nmunology is the branch of medicine involving disorders of the immune system, including asthma\\nand anaphylaxis, adverse reactions to drugs, autoimmune diseases, organ transplantations, and\\nmalignancies of the immune system. Physicians who specialize in this combined branch of \\nmedicine are called allergists and immunologists.\\nAnemias\\nAnemia (erythropenia, erythrocytopenia) is a deﬁciency in the number of erythrocytes or in the\\namount of hemoglobin within the red blood cells (hypochromia). It is not a disease but a symp-\\ntom of other illnesses.\\nAn important hereditary anemia that primarily aﬀects individuals of African ancestry is sickle\\ncell anemia. This anemia results from a defective hemoglobin molecule (hemoglobinopathy) that\\ncauses RBCs to assume bizarre shapes, commonly resembling a crescent, or sickle, when oxygen\\nlevels are low. Sickle cells are fragile and easily break apart (hemolyze). They have diﬃculty pass-\\ning through the small capillaries. (See Fig. 9-7.) Tissue distal to the blockage undergoes ischemia,\\nresulting in severe pain called a sickle cell crisis that can last from several hours to several days.\\nSickle cell anemia aﬀects only those who have inherited the trait from both parents. If the trait is\\ninherited from only one parent, the oﬀspring will be a carrier but will not have the disorder.\\nTreatment is designed to control or limit the number of crises. Folic acid is commonly recom-\\nmended, and some medications are proving to be helpful in controlling the disease.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 308}, page_content='Allergy\\nAn allergy is an acquired abnormal immune response. It requires an initial exposure (sensitiza-\\ntion) to an allergen (antigen). Subsequent exposures to the allergen produce increasing allergic\\nreactions that cause a broad range of inﬂammatory changes, including hives (urticaria), eczema,\\nallergic rhinitis, asthma, and, in the extreme, anaphylaxis, a life-threatening condition.\\nAllergy-sensitivity tests in which a suspension of the allergen is introduced into the skin iden-\\ntify oﬀending allergens. If the patient has an allergy to the suspected allergen, the area becomes\\nred, swollen, and hardened (indurated).\\nAllergy shots (immunotherapy, biotherapy) can help with an allergy response to pollens, \\npet dander, molds, dust mites, and venom (bee stings) but not to foods. Immunotherapy involves\\nrepeated injections of the allergen, beginning with a highly diluted solution and increasing the\\nconcentration over a period of weeks or months. When administered as an injection, the body\\ntreats the allergen like a vaccine and begins to produces antibodies against the allergen. The newly\\nformed antibodies desensitize the patient and reduce the reaction of the patient to the oﬀending\\nallergen. Allergy shots have been very successful in reducing or even eliminating the symptoms\\nassociated with the allergy.\\nDisease Focus 283\\nTable 9-3 Common Anemias\\nThis table lists various types of anemia, along with descriptions and causes.\\nType of Anemia Description Causes\\nAplastic (hypoplastic)\\nFolic-acid deficiency anemia\\nHemolytic\\nIron-deficiency anemia\\nPernicious anemia (PA)\\nSickle cell anemia\\nSerious form of anemia associated\\nwith bone marrow failure, resulting\\nin erythropenia, leukopenia, and\\nthrombocytopenia\\nInability to produce sufficient red\\nblood cells (RBCs) because of \\nthe lack of folic acid, a B vitamin \\nessential for erythropoiesis\\nDestruction of RBCs, commonly \\nresulting in jaundice\\nLack of sufficient iron in RBCs\\nChronic, progressive anemia found\\nmostly in people older than age 50\\nresulting from a lack of sufficient \\nvitamin B12 needed for blood cell \\ndevelopment\\nInherited anemia that causes RBCs\\nto become crescent- or sickle-\\nshaped when oxygen levels are low\\nCommonly caused by some autoimmune\\ndisorders, chemotherapy, radiation ther-\\napy, and exposure to certain cytotoxic\\nagents\\nCaused by insufficient folic acid intake \\nresulting from poor diet, impaired absorp-\\ntion, prolonged drug therapy, or increased\\nrequirements (pregnancy or rapid growth\\nas seen in children)\\nAssociated with some inherited immune\\nand blood (sickle cell anemia) disorders,\\nmedications, and incompatible transfusions\\nCaused by a greater demand for stored\\niron than can be supplied, usually as a \\nresult of inadequate dietary iron intake \\nor malabsorption of iron\\nCommonly the result of insufficient \\nintrinsic factor in the stomach essential \\nfor absorption of vitamin B12\\nCaused by a defect in the gene responsible\\nfor hemoglobin synthesis\\n5867_Ch09_267-304  12/01/17  12:20 PM  Page 283'),\n",

In this abnormal\\nresponse, the immune system produces autoantibodies directed at one or more of the individual’s\\ncells or tissues until they are destroyed. Types of autoimmune disorders range from those that \\naﬀect only a single organ to those that aﬀect many organs and systems (multisystemic). Autoim-\\nmune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple\\nsclerosis, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, and various thyroid disorders. Most autoimmune diseases\\nhave periods of ﬂare-ups (exacerbations) and latencies (remissions).\\nTreatment goals include reducing symptoms and controlling the autoimmune process while\\nmaintaining the body’s ability to ﬁght disease. Autoimmune diseases are usually chronic, requiring\\nlifelong care and monitoring, even when the person may look or feel well. Currently, few autoim-\\nmune diseases can be cured; however, with treatment, those aﬄicted can live relatively normal lives.\\nOncology\\nThe major types of blood cancers include multiple myelomas that aﬀect a single type of bone mar-\\nrow cell, lymphomas that arise in the lymphatic system, and leukemias that aﬀect blood and bone\\nmarrow.\\nLeukemia\\nLeukemia is an oncological disorder of blood and blood-forming organs and is characterized by\\nan overgrowth (proliferation) of blood cells. It is the most common cancer in children, adoles-\\ncents, and young adults. With this condition, the body replaces healthy blood and bone marrow\\ncells with immature, nonfunctional cells, leading to anemias, infections, and bleeding disorders.\\nThe various types of leukemia are generally identiﬁed by the type of leukocyte population aﬀected\\nas either granulocytic (myelogenous) or lymphocytic. They are further classiﬁed as chronic or\\nacute.\\nIn the acute form, the disease has a sudden onset and blood cells are highly embryonic (blastic)\\nwith few mature forms. Severe anemia, infections, and bleeding disorders appear early in the dis-\\nease. This form of leukemia is life-threatening.\\nIn the chronic form, signs and symptoms are slow to develop because there are usually enough\\nmature cells to carry on the functions of the various cell types. As the chronic form progresses,\\nsigns and symptoms develop.\\nAlthough the causes of leukemia are unknown, research has implicated viruses, environmental\\nconditions, high-dose radiation, and genetic factors. Bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow\\nbiopsy help diagnose leukemia. Treatment includes chemotherapy, radiation, bone marrow trans-\\nplant, or a combination of these modalities. Recent advances in treatment, such as monoclonal\\nantibody therapy, cancer vaccines, and donor lymphocyte infusions, are becoming more prevalent\\nin treatment. Leukemias are fatal if left untreated.\\n284 CHAPTER 9 \\x81 Blood, Lymphatic, and Immune Systems\\n5867_Ch09_267-304  12/01/17  12:20 PM  Page 284'),\n",

His hemoglobin was \\n6 upon admission. He says his baseline runs 7–8. The patient states that he has not had a splenec-\\ntomy. He describes the pain as midabdominal and cramplike. He denied any chills, fevers, or sweats.\\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:\\nProblem 1. Sickle cell crisis. Patient was admitted to a medical-surgical bed, and placed on oxygen and\\nIV fluids. He received morphine for analgesia as well as Vicodin. At discharge, his abdominal pain\\nhad resolved; however, he reported weakness. He was kept for an additional day for observation.\\nProblem 2. CT scan was performed on the belly and showed evidence of ileus in the small bowel with\\nsomewhat dilated small-bowel loops and also an abnormal enhancement pattern in the kidney. The\\npatient has had no nausea or vomiting. He is moving his bowels without any difficulty. He is ambu-\\nlating. He even goes outside to smoke cigarettes, which he has been advised not to do.

The\\nbones of the skull protect the brain; the rib cage protects the heart and lungs; the pelvic bones\\nprotect the developing fetus and reproductive organs. Movement is possible because bones pro-\\nvide points of attachment for muscles, tendons, and ligaments. As muscles contract, tendons and\\nligaments pull on bones and cause skeletal movement. Bones serve as a storehouse for minerals,\\nparticularly phosphorus and calcium.\\nBone Types\\nThere are four principal types of bone:\\n• Short bones are somewhat cube-shaped and are nearly equal in length and width. Exam-\\nples of short bones include the bones of the wrist (carpals) and ankles (tarsals).\\n• Irregular bones include the bones that cannot be classiﬁed as short or long because of\\ntheir complex shapes. Examples of irregular bones include vertebrae and the bones of the\\nmiddle ear.\\n• Flat bones are exactly what their name suggests. They provide broad surfaces for muscular\\nattachment or protection for internal organs. Examples of ﬂat bones include bones of the\\nskull, shoulder blades, and sternum.\\n• Long bones are found in the extremities of the body, such as the legs, arms, and ﬁngers.\\nThe long bones have regular, well-deﬁned shapes. (See Fig. 10-2, page 312.) Each long\\nbone has three main parts:\\n• The (1) diaphysis is the shaft, or long, main portion of a bone. It consists of compact\\nbone that forms a cylinder and surrounds a central canal called the (2) medullary cavity.\\nThe medullary cavity is ﬁlled with “yellow bone marrow,” so named because it is com-\\nposed mainly of blood vessels and fatty tissue.\\n• The (3) distal epiphysis and (4) proximal epiphysis (plural, epiphyses) are the two ends\\nof the bones. Both ends have a somewhat bulbous shape to provide space for muscle and\\nligament attachments near the joints. Each epiphysis consists of three layers of tissue:\\n• (5) articular cartilage, which is a thin outer layer of cartilage where bones meet to form\\njoints, and the (6) epiphyseal line (growth plate), an area of cartilage constantly being\\nreplaced by new bone tissue as the bone grows and that is responsible for lengthening\\nbones during childhood and adolescence and calciﬁes and disappears when the bone has\\nachieved its full growth\\n• thick, dense layer of hard (7) compact bone\\n• inner layer of porous tissue called (8) spongy or cancellous bone that is less dense than\\ncompact bone and is ﬁlled with red bone marrow, so named because it is composed\\nmainly of blood cells in various stages of development.\\n• The (9) periosteum, a dense, white, ﬁbrous membrane, covers the remaining surface of the\\nbone. It contains numerous blood and lymph vessels and nerves. In growing bones, the\\ninner layer contains the bone-forming cells known as osteoblasts. The periosteum pro-\\nvides a means for bone repair and general bone nutrition. The periosteum also serves as a\\npoint of attachment for muscles, ligaments, and tendons.\\nAnatomy and Physiology 311\\n5867_Ch10_305-356  11/01/17  11:25 AM  Page 311'),\n",

One (2) parietal bone is situated on each side of the skull just behind the frontal\\nbone. Together they form the upper sides and roof of the cranium. Each parietal bone meets the\\nfrontal bone along the (3) coronal suture. A single (4) occipital bone forms the back and base of\\nthe skull. It contains an opening in its base through which the spinal cord passes. Two (5) tem-\\nporal bone(s), one on each side of the skull, form part of the lower cranium.

The bones of each hand in-\\nclude eight (7) carpals (wrist), ﬁve radiating (8) metacarpals (palm), and ten radiating (9) phalanges\\n(ﬁngers).\\nPelvic Girdle\\nThe (10) pelvic girdle (hip bone) is a basin-shaped structure that attaches the lower limbs to the\\naxial skeleton. Along with its associated ligaments, it supports the trunk of the body and provides\\nprotection for lower organs of digestion and urinary and reproductive structures.\\nMale and female pelves (singular, pelvis) diﬀer considerably in size and shape but share the\\nsame basic structures. Generally, the bones of males are larger and heavier and possess larger sur-\\nface markings than those of females of comparable age and physical stature. Some of the diﬀer-\\nences are attributable to the function of the female pelvis during childbearing. The female pelvis\\nis shallower than the male pelvis but wider in all directions. The female pelvis not only supports\\nthe enlarged uterus as the fetus matures but also provides a large opening to allow the infant to\\npass through during birth. Regardless of these diﬀerences, the female and male pelves are divided\\ninto the (11) ilium, (12) ischium, and (13) pubis. These three bones fuse together in the adult\\nto form a single hip bone called the innominate bone. The ilium travels inferiorly to form part\\nof the (14) acetabulum, the deep socket of the hip joint, and joins the pubis. The bladder is \\nlocated behind the (15) symphysis pubis; the rectum is in the curve of the (16) sacrum and \\n(17) coccyx. In the female, the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and vagina are located between the\\nbladder and the rectum.\\nLower Limbs\\nThe lower limbs support the complete weight of the erect body and are subjected to exceptional\\nstresses, especially in running or jumping. To accommodate for these forces, the lower limb bones\\nare stronger and thicker than comparable bones of the upper limbs.\\nThere are three parts of each lower limb: the thigh, the leg, and the foot. The thigh consists\\nof a single bone called the (18) femur. It is the largest, longest, and strongest bone in the body.\\nThe leg is formed by two parallel bones: the (19) tibia and the (20) ﬁbula. A small triangular\\nbone, the (21) patella (kneecap), is located anterior to the knee joint. The seven (22) tarsals \\n(ankle bones) resemble metacarpals (wrist bones) in structure. Lastly, the bones of each foot \\ninclude the (23) metatarsals, which consists of ﬁve small long bones numbered 1 to 5 beginning\\nwith the great toe on the medial side of the foot, and the much smaller (24) phalanges (toes).\\nJoints or Articulations\\nTo allow for body movements, bones must have points where they meet (articulate).These articulat-\\ning points form joints that have various degrees of mobility. The joint capsulecontains a lubrication\\nﬂuid (synovial ﬂuid) that nourishes and protects the joint. The need for greater or lesser ﬂexibility \\ndetermines the type of joint in any speciﬁc location. There are three types of joints. All three types\\nare necessary for smooth, coordinated body movements. Freely movable joints (diarthroses) are \\nencased in a sleevelike extension of the periosteum, such as the hinge joints of the elbow (between\\nthe humerus and ulna). Slightly movable joints (amphiarthroses) are articulations between two bones\\nconnected by ligaments or elastic cartilage, such as those between the vertebrae. Immovable joints\\n(synarthroses)are joints that have no mobility, such as those that constitute the sutures of the skull.\\nAnatomy and Physiology 319\\n5867_Ch10_305-356  11/01/17  11:25 AM  Page 319'),\n",

Pain and discomfort commonly\\nassociated with these disorders may interfere with everyday activities. These disorders are extremely\\ncommon, and risk increases with age. Early diagnosis is the key to easing pain while potentially\\ndecreasing further bodily damage.\\nGiven the diﬀerent areas of the body that make up the musculoskeletal system, several other\\ndiseases can produce signiﬁcant musculoskeletal signs and symptoms. These disorders include but\\nare not limited to lower back pain, ﬁbromyalgia, gout, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and\\ntendinitis. Some of these disorders can cause mild discomfort to debilitating pain. Low back pain\\nis the most common musculoskeletal disorder.\\nFor diagnosis, treatment, and management of musculoskeletal disorders, the medical services of\\na specialist may be warranted.

These physi-\\ncians use medical, physical, and surgical methods to restore function that has been lost as a result\\nof musculoskeletal injury or disease. Another physician who specializes in treating joint disease is\\na rheumatologist. Still another physician, a Doctor of Osteopathy (DO), maintains that good\\nhealth requires proper alignment of bones, muscles, ligaments, and nerves. Like medical doctors,\\nosteopathic physicians combine manipulative procedures with state-of-the-art methods of medical\\ntreatment, including prescribing drugs and performing surgeries. The osteopathic physician has the\\nsame rights, privileges, and responsibilities as the Doctor of Medicine (MD).\\nFractures\\nA fracture is a break or crack in a bone. Fractures can range in severity from a simple hairline\\ncrack to the most serious type, where the end of the broken bone pierces through the ﬂesh (open\\nfracture, compound fracture). Fractures usually result from trauma but may also be caused by\\ndisease (pathological fracture). Imaging procedures conﬁrm and determine the severity of frac-\\ntures. Figure 10-8 on page 330 illustrates some common types of fractures.\\nTreatment of fractures involves restoring the bone to its normal position (reduction). In a\\nclosed reduction, the practitioner repairs the fracture without a surgical incision of the area by\\naligning the bone through manual manipulation or traction. Once the practitioner reduces the\\nfracture, the bone is immobilized using a cast or sling to maintain the position of the bone until\\nhealing occurs. In an open reduction, realignment of the two broken ends of the bone takes place\\nunder direct observation by exposing the fracture using surgery. It is required when a bone pierces\\nthrough the skin (compound fracture), when the practitioner cannot align the bone through\\nclosed reduction, or when the fracture extends into a joint. Internal ﬁxation devices, such as\\nscrews, pins, wires, and nails, stabilize the bone to maintain alignment while healing takes place.\\nIf the bone has a hairline or minor fracture, no repair may be necessary, except rest and refrain-\\ning from doing activities that aggravate the area until it is healed. For larger fractures and pain\\nthat persists, the practitioner will immobilize the area.\\nArthritis\\nArthritis, a general term for many joint diseases, is an inﬂammation of a joint, usually accompa-\\nnied by pain, swelling, and deformity. Because of their location and constant use, joints are prone\\nto stress injuries and inﬂammation. The main types of arthritis are rheumatoid arthritis and \\nosteoarthritis.\\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA), a systemic disease characterized by inﬂammatory changes in\\njoints and their related structures, results in crippling deformities. (See Fig. 10-9, on page 331.)\\nThis form of arthritis is caused by an autoimmune disease that destroys joint tissue. It occurs most\\ncommonly in women between ages 23 and 35 but can aﬀect people of any age group. Flare-ups\\n(exacerbations)of this disease are commonly associated with periods of increased physical or\\nemotional stress. In addition to joint changes, adjacent muscles, bones, and skin atrophy. There\\nis no speciﬁc cure, but NSAIDs, physical therapy, and orthopedic measures help treat less severe\\ncases.\\nOsteoarthritis, also known as degenerative joint disease (DJD) , is by far the most common\\nform of arthritis. It is a progressive, degenerative disease that occurs when the protective cartilage\\nat the end of the bones wears down. Pain and stiﬀness in the joints are the most common symp-\\ntoms. The pain is commonly worse after exercise and when putting weight or pressure on the\\njoint. Over time, the joints become stiﬀer and harder to move. There may also be a rubbing, grat-\\ning, or crackling sound (crepitation) with movement of the joint. Nevertheless, some persons are\\nasymptomatic, even though x-rays show the changes of osteoarthritis. Almost everyone has some\\nsymptoms by age 70, but these symptoms may be minor. The joints most commonly aﬀected \\ninclude the hands, knees, hips, and spine. There is a higher risk of DJD in younger athletes and\\noverweight individuals of all ages. Playing sports that involve direct impact on the joint (such as\\ntennis or football), twisting (such as basketball or soccer), and throwing also increase the risk of\\nosteoarthritis.

These symptoms occur primarily in boys and develop rapidly. By\\nabout 12 years of age, those aﬄicted are unable to walk. As the disease progresses, swallowing\\nand breathing become diﬃcult, and a respirator is required. With other types of muscular dystro-\\nphy, symptoms may not surface until adulthood.\\nThere is no cure for muscular dystrophy. However, medications and therapy can help manage\\nsymptoms and slow the course of the disease.\\nOncology\\nTwo major types of malignancies that aﬀect bone are those that arise directly from bone, called\\nprimary bone cancer, and those that arise in another region of the body and spread (metastasize)\\nto bone, called secondary bone cancer. Primary bone cancers are rare, but secondary bone cancers\\nare quite prevalent. They are usually caused by malignant cells that have metastasized to the bone\\nfrom the lungs, breast, or prostate.\\nMalignancies that originate from bone, fat, muscle, cartilage, bone marrow, and cells of the\\nlymphatic system are called sarcomas. Three major types of sarcomas are ﬁbrosarcoma, \\nosteosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma. Fibrosarcoma develops in cartilage and generally aﬀects the\\npelvis, upper legs, and shoulders. Patients with ﬁbrosarcoma are usually between ages 50 and 60.\\nOsteosarcoma develops from bone tissue and generally aﬀects the knees, upper arms, and upper\\nlegs. Patients with osteosarcoma are usually between ages 20 and 25. Ewing sarcoma develops\\nfrom primitive nerve cells in bone marrow. It usually aﬀects the shaft of long bones but may \\noccur in the pelvis or other bones of the arms or legs. This disease usually aﬀects boys between\\nages 10 and 20.\\nSigns and symptoms of sarcoma include swelling and tenderness, with a tendency toward\\nfractures in the affected area. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bone scan, and a computed\\ntomography (CT) scan are diagnostic tests that assist in identifying bone malignancies. All ma-\\nlignancies, including Ewing sarcoma, are staged and graded to determine the extent and degree\\nof malignancy. This staging helps the physician determine an appropriate treatment modality.\\nGenerally, the practitioner will use combination therapy to treat sarcomas, including\\nchemotherapy for management of metastasis and radiation when the tumor is radiosensitive.\\nIn some cases, amputation is required.\\nDisease Focus 331\\nWrist bones\\nMetacarpophalangeal\\njoints\\nProximal\\ninterphalangeal\\njoints\\nFigure 10-9 Rheumatoid arthritis.\\n5867_Ch10_305-356  11/01/17  11:25 AM  Page 331'),\n",

Equally important is the proper balance of electrolytes, which are crucial\\nto operation of the brain, nerves, and muscles and essential for tissue repair. Along with regulat-\\ning the composition of extracellular ﬂuids, the kidneys also secrete the hormone erythropoietin.\\nThis hormone acts on bone marrow to stimulate production of red blood cells when blood oxygen\\nlevels are low.\\nThe (1) left and right kidneys, each about the size of a fist, are located in the abdominal \\ncavity slightly above the waistline. The location of the kidneys is retroperitoneal because they\\nare located outside of the peritoneum. A concave medial border gives the kidney its beanlike\\nshape. In the cross section, two distinct areas are visible: an outer area, the (2) renal cortex, and\\na middle area, the (3) renal medulla. These structures contain portions of the microscopic \\nfiltering units of the kidney, the nephrons. Near the medial border is the (4) hilum (or hilus),\\nan opening through which the (5) renal artery enters and the (6) renal vein exits the kidney.\\nAfter the kidneys remove waste products during urine formation, the filtered blood leaves the\\nkidney by way of the renal vein. Urine, now carrying waste products, enters the (7) renal pelvis,\\na hollow cavity formed where the (8) ureter merges with the kidney. Each ureter is a slender\\ntube approximately 10˝ to 12˝ long. They carry urine in peristaltic waves to the bladder. These\\nwaves keep urine flowing toward the bladder, rather than regurgitating back into the kidney\\nduring urination when bladder pressure increases. Urine enters the bladder at the (9) ureteral\\norifice. The (10) urinary bladder, an expandable hollow organ, acts as a temporary reservoir\\nfor urine. The bladder has small folds called rugae that expand as the bladder fills. At its base,\\nthe two openings of the ureters and the urethra form a triangular area called the trigone that\\nleads into the (11) urethra, a tube that discharges urine from the bladder. The length of the\\nurethra is approximately 1.5˝ in women and about 7˝ to 8˝ in men. In the male, the urethra\\npasses through the prostate gland and the penis. During urination (micturition), the body \\nexpels urine through an opening in the urethra, the (12) urinary meatus.\\nMicroscopic Structures\\nMicroscopic examination of kidney tissue reveals the presence of approximately 1 million\\nnephrons. These microscopic structures maintain homeostasis by continually adjusting and\\nregulating the composition, volume, and pH of blood plasma and tissue fluid. Substances \\nremoved by nephrons include nitrogenous wastes, excess electrolytes, and many other products\\nthat exceed the amount tolerated by the body. Each nephron includes a renal corpuscle and a\\nrenal tubule. (See Fig. 11-2.) The renal corpuscle is composed of a tuft of capillaries called \\nthe (1) glomerulus and a modified, enlarged extension of the renal tubule known as the \\n(2) Bowman (glomerular) capsule that surrounds the glomerulus. A larger (3) aﬀerent arteriole\\ncarries blood to the glomerulus, and a smaller (4) efferent arteriole carries blood from the\\nglomerulus. The difference in the size of these vessels provides the needed pressure to force \\nfluids and soluble material from blood plasma into the Bowman capsule. These substances,\\nnow called filtrate, resemble plasma except that the amount of protein in filtrate is less than\\nthat found in plasma.\\nThe eﬀerent arteriole passes behind the renal corpuscle to form the (5) peritubular capillaries,\\na network of capillaries that surround the renal tubule. The renal tubule consists of four sections:\\nthe (6) proximal convoluted tubule, followed by the narrow (7) loop of Henle, then the larger \\n(8) distal tubule and, ﬁnally, the (9) collecting tubule. The collecting tubule transports newly\\nformed urine to the renal pelvis for excretion by the kidneys.\\nThe nephron performs three physiological functions as it produces urine:\\n1. Filtration occurs in the renal corpuscle as water, electrolytes, sugar, and other small \\nmolecules in blood plasma in the aﬀerent tubule pass into the Bowman capsule to form \\nﬁltrate.\\n360 CHAPTER 11 \\x81 Urinary System\\n5867_Ch11_357-394  11/01/17  11:26 AM  Page 360'),\n",

Asymptomatic urinary diseases are com-\\nmonly found when a routine urinalysis identiﬁes abnormalities. When symptoms are present, they\\nusually include changes in urination pattern, changes in output, or pain during urination (dysuria).\\nEndoscopic tests, radiological evaluations, and laboratory tests that evaluate renal function typically\\nidentify disorders of the urinary system.\\nFor diagnosis, treatment, and management of urinary disorders, the medical services of a spe-\\ncialist may be warranted. Urology is the branch of medicine concerned with urinary disorders and\\ndiseases of the male reproductive system. The physician who specializes in diagnosis and treatment\\nof genitourinary disorders is known as a urologist. However, the branch of medicine concerned\\nspeciﬁcally with diseases of the kidney, electrolyte imbalance, renal transplantation, and dialysis\\ntherapy is a nephrology. Physicians who practice in this specialty are called nephrologists.\\nGlomerulonephritis\\nGlomerulonephritis is an inﬂammation of the glomerular membrane in the nephrons, causing it\\nto become “leaky” (permeable). Red blood cells and protein, which normally remain in blood,\\npass through the inﬂamed glomerular membrane and enter the tubule. Urinalysis reveals protein\\nin the urine (proteinuria), blood in the urine (hematuria), and bacteria in the urine (bacteruria),\\nindicators of infection or inﬂammation. Other signs and symptoms include high blood pressure\\n(hypertension), edema, and impaired renal function.\\nCauses of glomerulonephritis include bacterial endocarditis, viral infections, and autoimmune \\ndiseases. Another cause of glomerular inﬂammation is a reaction to the toxins produced by pathogenic\\nbacteria, especially streptococci that have recently infected another part of the body, usually “strep\\nthroat.” Most patients with acute glomerulonephritis associated with a streptococcal infection recover\\nwith no lasting kidney damage. Because most forms of glomerulonephritis are a consequence of \\nanother disorder, treatment of the underlying cause is important in the management of this disease.\\nNephrolithiasis\\nStones (calculi) may form in any part of the urinary tract (urolithiasis), but most arise in the \\nkidney (nephrolithiasis). (See Fig. 11-3, page 368.) They commonly form when dissolved urine\\n5867_Ch11_357-394  11/01/17  11:26 AM  Page 367'),\n",

As the stones become larger, they commonly lodge in the ureters\\n(ureterolithiasis), causing an intense, throbbing pain (colic). Because urine has diﬃculty passing\\ninto the bladder, it ﬂows backward (reﬂuxes) into the renal pelvis, causing it to dilate.\\nTreatment includes pulverizing the stone using concentrated ultrasound shock waves, gener-\\nated from a machine outside the body (extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy [ESWL]). (See\\nFig. 11-4.) For patients who have contraindication to ESWL, an alternative minimally invasive\\nsurgery is available. In this procedure, the surgeon makes a small incision through the skin to \\ncreate an opening into the kidney to remove the stone (percutaneous nephrolithotomy\\n[PCNL]). If the stone is large, the surgeon breaks it into smaller fragments using an ultrasonic\\nor electrohydraulic probe (lithotriptor) to remove the smaller fragments more easily. The surgeon\\nmay also insert a nephrostomy tube to drain urine from the kidney during the healing process.\\n368 CHAPTER 11 \\x81 Urinary System\\nKidney stones\\nECG\\nMonitor\\nWater bags\\nKidney stone\\nShock-wave\\ngenerator\\nEllipsoidal\\nreflector\\nWater\\ncolumn\\nFigure 11-4 Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy.\\nFigure 11-3 Kidney stones in the calices and ureter.\\n5867_Ch11_357-394  11/01/17  11:26 AM  Page 368'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 394}, page_content='Acute Tubular Necrosis\\nIn acute tubular necrosis (ATN), the tubular portion of the nephron is injured after the ingestion\\nof toxic drugs (nephrotoxic ATN) or by a decrease in blood supply (ischemic ATN). Circulatory\\ncollapse, severe hypotension, hemorrhage, dehydration, or other disorders that aﬀect blood \\nsupply are the common causes of ischemic ATN. Because speciﬁc signs and symptoms are not\\nassociated with ATN, the diagnosis relies on a positive history of risk factors. Nonspeciﬁc signs\\nand symptoms of ATN commonly include scanty urine production (oliguria), ﬂuid retention,\\nmental apathy, nausea, vomiting, and increased blood levels of calcium (hypercalcemia). When\\ntubular damage is not severe, the disorder is usually reversible.\\nOncology\\nBladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men and the eighth most common cancer in\\nwomen. Two types of bladder cancer are transitional cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Transi-\\ntional cell carcinoma accounts for 95% of bladder cancers in the United States. Transitional cells\\nline the bladder and the inside of the ureters and urethra. They are able to expand when the bladder\\nis full and contract when it is empty. As bladder cancer progresses, malignant tumors invade the\\nbladder, ureters, and urethra.\\nAdenocarcinoma, a less common type of bladder cancer, accounts for only 1% of bladder \\ncancers in the United States. This malignancy arises from mucus-secreting glands in the bladder\\nand generally tends to be invasive.\\nSigns and symptoms of bladder cancer include hematuria, frequency, dysuria, and abdominal\\nor back pain. Diagnostic tests include cystoscopy with biopsy of suspicious lesions and urine \\ncytology, in which malignant cells appear in a urine sample.\\nTreatment depends on the type, stage, and grade of the malignancy. In the early stages when\\nthe malignancy is conﬁned to the bladder lining, the practitioner employs an electric current or\\nhigh-energy laser using a device passed through the urethra (transurethral resection of bladder\\ntumor [TURBT]) to destroy malignant tissue. Advanced cancers require the removal of the\\nbladder (cystectomy). Surgery combined with treatments that stimulate the immune response\\n(biological therapy; immunotherapy), chemotherapy delivered intravenously or directly into\\nthe bladder (intravesical), and radiation therapy are other treatment options.\\nDisease Focus       369\\nDiseases and Conditions\\nThis section introduces diseases and conditions of the urinary system, along with their meanings\\nand pronunciations.

The female reproductive system\\nalso produces the female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone, which play an important role\\nin the reproductive process. These hormones are responsible for the development of secondary sex\\ncharacteristics, such as breast development and regulation of the menstrual cycle.\\nFemale Reproductive Structures\\nThe female reproductive system is composed of the internal organs of reproduction and the exter-\\nnal genitalia. (See Fig. 12-1.) The internal organs include the (1) ovaries, (2) fallopian tubes, \\n(3) uterus, and (4) vagina. The external genitalia are collectively known as the vulva. Included in\\nthese structures are the (5) labia minora, (6) labia majora, (7) clitoris, (8) Bartholin glands, and\\nmons pubis, an elevation of adipose tissue covered by skin and coarse pubic hair that cushions the\\npubis (pubic bone).

They also pre-\\npare the uterus for implantation of the fertilized egg, help maintain pregnancy, promote\\ngrowth of the placenta, and play an important role in development of secondary sex character-\\nistics. (See Chapter 14, Endocrine System.)\\nFallopian Tubes\\nTwo (5) fallopian tubes (oviducts, uterine tubes) extend laterally from superior angles of \\nthe uterus. The (6) fimbriae are fingerlike projections that create wavelike currents in fluid\\nsurrounding the ovary to move the ovum into the uterine tube. If the egg unites with a sper-\\nmatozoon, the male reproductive cell, fertilization (or conception) takes place. The fertilized\\negg then continues its journey to the uterus, where it implants on the uterine wall. If concep-\\ntion does not occur, the ovum disintegrates within 48 hours and is discharged through the\\nvagina.\\nUterus and Vagina\\nThe (7) uterus contains and nourishes the embryo from the time the fertilized egg is implanted\\nuntil the fetus is born. It is a muscular, hollow structure shaped like an inverted pear and is located\\nin the pelvic area between the bladder and rectum. The uterus normally tilts forward (anteﬂexion)\\nin the pelvic cavity and consists of three parts: the (8) fundus, the upper, rounded part; the \\n(9) body, the central part; and the (10) cervix, also called the neck of the uterus or cervix uteri,\\nthe inferior constricted portion that opens into the vagina.\\nThe (11) vagina is a muscular tube that extends from the cervix to the exterior of the body.\\nIts lining consists of folds of mucous membrane that give the organ an elastic quality. During\\nsexual excitement, the vaginal orifice is lubricated by secretions from (12) Bartholin glands. In\\naddition to serving as the organ of sexual intercourse and receptor of semen, the vagina dis-\\ncharges menstrual flow. It also acts as a passageway for the delivery of the fetus. The clitoris,\\nlocated anterior to the vaginal orifice, is composed of erectile tissue that is richly innervated\\nwith sensory endings. The clitoris is similar in structure to the penis in the male, but it is\\nsmaller and has no urethra. The area between the vaginal orifice and the anus is known as the\\n398 CHAPTER 12 \\x81 Female Reproductive System\\n(4) Corpus luteum\\nFertilization of ovum\\n(5) Fallopian tube\\n(7) Uterus\\n(8) Fundus of uterus\\n(6) Fimbriae\\n(1) Ovary\\nOvarian ligament\\n(9) Body of uterus\\nEndometrium\\nMyometrium\\nSperm\\n(10) Cervix\\n(11) Vagina\\nRugae\\n(12) Bartholin glands\\nArtery\\nVein\\n(3) Mature follicle\\n(2) Graafian follicles\\nFigure 12-2 Anterior view of the female reproductive system with the developing follicles shown in the cross \\nsection of the right ovary.\\n5867_Ch12_395-438  11/01/17  11:27 AM  Page 398'),\n",

Breasts begin to develop during puberty as a result of periodic stimulation of\\nthe ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone and are fully developed by age 16. Estrogen is\\nresponsible for the development of (1) adipose tissue, which enlarges the size of the breasts un-\\ntil they reach full maturity. Breast size is primarily determined by the amount of fat around \\nthe glandular tissue but is not indicative of functional ability. Each breast is composed of 15 to\\n20 lobules of milk-producing glands that are drained by a (2) lactiferous duct, which opens on\\nthe tip of the raised (3) nipple. Circling the nipple is a border of slightly darker skin called the\\n(4) areola. During pregnancy, the breasts enlarge and remain so until lactation ceases. At\\nmenopause, breast tissue begins to atrophy.\\nMenstrual Cycle\\nMenarche, the initial menstrual period, occurs at puberty (about age 12), and menstruation\\ncontinues for approximately 40 years, except during pregnancy. The menstrual cycle consists of\\na series of phases, during which the uterine endometrium changes as it responds to changing\\nlevels of ovarian hormones. (See Table 12-1.) The duration of the menstrual cycle is approxi-\\nmately 28 days. (See Fig. 12-4.)\\nPregnancy\\nDuring pregnancy, the uterus changes its shape, size, and consistency. It increases greatly in size\\nand muscle mass; houses the growing placenta, which nourishes the embryo-fetus; and expels the\\nfetus after gestation. To prepare to serve as the birth canal at the end of pregnancy, the vaginal\\ncanal elongates as the uterus rises in the pelvis. The mucosa thickens, secretions increase, and the\\nvascularity and elasticity of the cervix and vagina become more pronounced.\\nThe average pregnancy (gestation) lasts approximately 9 months and is followed by childbirth\\n(parturition). Up to the third month of pregnancy, the product of conception is referred to as the\\nembryo.From the third month to the time of birth, the unborn oﬀspring is referred to as thefetus.\\nPregnancy also causes enlargement of the breasts, sometimes to the point of pain. Many\\nother changes occur throughout the body to accommodate the development and birth of the\\n400 CHAPTER 12 \\x81 Female Reproductive System\\nTable 12-1 Phases of the Menstrual Cycle\\nThis table outlines the changes involved during the typical 28-day menstrual cycle.\\nPhase Description\\nMenstrual\\nDays 1–5\\nOvulatory\\nDays 6–14\\nPostovulatory\\nDays 15–28\\nUterine endometrium sloughs off because of hormonal stimulation, a process \\naccompanied by bleeding. The detached tissue and blood are discharged through \\nthe vagina as menstrual flow.\\nWhen menstruation ceases, the endometrium begins to thicken as new tissue is \\nrebuilt. As the estrogen level rises, several ova begin to mature in the graafian \\nfollicles, usually with only one ovum reaching full maturity. At about the 14th day \\nof the cycle, the graafian follicle ruptures, releasing the egg, a process called ovulation.\\nThe egg then leaves the ovary and travels down the fallopian tube toward the uterus.\\nThe empty graafian follicle fills with a yellow material and is now called the corpus luteum.\\nSecretions of estrogen and progesterone by the corpus luteum stimulate the building of\\nthe endometrium in preparation for implantation of an embryo. If fertilization does not\\noccur, the corpus luteum begins to degenerate as estrogen and progesterone levels \\ndecrease.* With decreased hormone levels, the uterine lining begins to shed, the \\nmenstrual cycle starts over again, and the first day of menstruation begins.\\n*Some women experience a loose grouping of symptoms called premenstrual syndrome (PMS). These symptoms usually occur\\nabout 5 days after the decrease in hormone levels and include nervous tension, irritability, headaches, breast tenderness, and\\na feeling of depression.\\n5867_Ch12_395-438  11/01/17  11:27 AM  Page 400'),\n",

At this time, the full-term fetus is usually positioned head down within the uterus.\\nLabor and Childbirth\\nLabor is the physiological process by which the fetus is expelled from the uterus. Labor occurs in\\nthree stages. The ﬁrst is the stage of dilation, which begins with uterine contractions and termi-\\nnates when there is complete dilation of the cervix (10 cm). The second is the stage of expulsion,\\nthe time from complete cervical dilation to birth of the baby. The last stage is the placental stage,\\nor afterbirth. This stage begins shortly after childbirth when the uterine contractions discharge\\nthe placenta from the uterus.

Menopause is usually diagnosed if absence of menses (amenorrhea) has persisted\\nfor 1 year. The period in which symptoms of approaching menopause occur is known as the\\nchange of lifeor the climacteric.\\nMany women experience hot ﬂashes and vaginal drying and thinning (vaginal atrophy) as es-\\ntrogen levels fall. Although hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has become more controver-\\nsial, it is still used to treat vaginal atrophy and porous bones (osteoporosis), and it is believed to\\nplay a role in heart attack prevention. Restraint in prescribing estrogens for long periods in all\\nmenopausal women arises from concern that there is an increased risk that long-term usage will\\ninduce neoplastic changes in estrogen-sensitive aging tissue.\\nOvarian activityUterine activity\\nDeveloping ovum Ovulation Breaking down of ovum\\nGraafian\\nfollicles\\nCorpus\\nluteum\\nHormone\\nlevels\\nHigh\\nLow\\nMenstrual Menstrual\\nEndometrium repairs\\nOvulatory\\nEndometrium builds up Endometrium \\nbreaks down\\nDAYS 1–5 6–14 15–28 DAY 1\\nPhase\\nPostovulatory\\nFigure 12-4 Menstrual cycle.\\nAnatomy and Physiology 401\\n5867_Ch12_395-438  11/01/17  11:27 AM  Page 401'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 434}, page_content='Disease Focus\\nFemale reproductive disorders may be caused by infection, injury, or hormonal dysfunction. \\nAlthough some disorders may be mild and correct themselves over time, others, such as those\\ncaused by infection, may require medical attention. Pain, itching, lesions, and discharge are signs\\nand symptoms commonly associated with sexually transmitted diseases and must not be ignored.\\nOther common problems of the female reproductive system are related to hormonal dysfunction\\nthat may cause menstrual disorders.\\nAs a preventive measure, a woman should undergo pelvic examination regularly throughout\\nlife. This diagnostic procedure helps identify many pelvic abnormalities and diseases. Cytological\\nand bacteriological specimens are usually obtained at the time of examination.\\nGynecology (GYN) is the branch of medicine concerned with diseases of the female reproduc-\\ntive organs and breasts. Obstetrics (OB) is the branch of medicine that manages the health of a\\nwoman and her fetus during pregnancy and childbirth. It also includes the puerperium, which \\nis the period of adjustment after childbirth during which the reproductive organs of the mother\\nreturn to their normal, nonpregnant state. Generally, this period lasts 6 to 8 weeks and ends with\\nthe ﬁrst ovulation and the return of normal menstruation. Because of the obvious overlap between\\ngynecology and obstetrics, many practices include both specialties. The physician who simultane-\\nously practices these specialties is called an obstetrician/gynecologist (OB/GYN).\\nEndometriosis\\nEndometriosis is the presence of functional endometrial tissue in areas outside the uterus. (See\\nFig. 12-6.) The endometrial tissue develops into what are called implants, lesions, or growths\\nand can cause pain, infertility, and other problems. The ectopic tissue is usually conﬁned to the\\npelvic area but may appear anywhere in the abdominopelvic cavity. Like normal endometrial \\ntissue, the ectopic endometrium responds to the hormonal ﬂuctuations of the menstrual cycle.\\nDisease Focus 409\\nScar on \\nabdominal wall\\nAnterior cul-de-sac\\nand bladder\\nUmbilicus\\nOvary\\nUterine wall\\nVulva\\nPerineum\\nPelvic colon\\nPosterior \\ncul-de-sac\\nRectovaginal\\nseptum\\nPosterior surface of uterus\\nand uterosacral ligaments\\nFigure 12-6 Endometriosis.\\nPelvic Inflammatory Disease\\nPelvic inﬂammatory disease (PID) is a general term for inﬂammation of the uterus, fallopian\\ntubes, ovaries, and adjacent pelvic structures. It is usually caused by bacterial infection, but other\\norganisms may be implicated. These disease-producing organisms (pathogens) generally enter\\n5867_Ch12_395-438  11/01/17  11:27 AM  Page 409'),\n",

As an\\nascending infection, the pathogens spread from the vagina and cervix to the upper structures of\\nthe female reproductive tract. Untreated gonorrhea and chlamydia cause about 90% of all cases\\nof PID. Other causes include abortion, childbirth, and pelvic procedures.\\nThe symptoms of PID can vary and may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge,\\nfever, nausea, and vomiting. If diagnosed at an early stage, PID can be treated easily and eﬀec-\\ntively with antibiotics. If left untreated, it can lead to more serious, long-term complications.\\nOncology\\nThe two most common forms of cancer (CA) involving the female reproductive system are breast\\ncancer and cervical cancer.\\nBreast Cancer\\nBreast cancer, also called carcinoma of the breast, is the most common malignancy of women in\\nthe United States. This disease appears to be associated with ovarian hormonal function. In \\naddition, a diet high in fats appears to increase the incidence of breast cancer. Other contributing\\nfactors include a family history of the disease and, possibly, the use of hormone replacement ther-\\napy (HRT). Women who have never had children (nulliparous) or those who have had an early\\nonset of the ﬁrst menstrual period (menarche) or late onset of menopause are also more likely to\\ndevelop breast cancer. Because this type of malignancy is highly responsive to treatment when \\ndetected early, women are urged to practice breast self-examination monthly and to receive peri-\\nodic mammograms after age 40. Many breast malignancies are detected by the patient.\\nCervical Cancer\\nCancer of the cervix most commonly aﬀects women between ages 40 and 49. Statistics indicate\\nthat infection associated with sexual activity has some relationship to the incidence of cervical\\ncancer. First coitus at a young age, a large number of sex partners, infection with certain sexually\\ntransmitted viruses, and frequent intercourse with men whose previous partners had cervical \\ncancer are all associated with increased risk of developing cervical cancer.\\nThe Pap test, a cytological examination, can detect cervical cancer before the disease becomes\\nclinically evident. Abnormal cervical cytology routinely calls for colposcopy, which can detect the\\npresence and extent of preclinical lesions requiring biopsy and histological examination. Treat-\\nment of cervical cancer consists of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. If left untreated, the\\ncancer will eventually metastasize and lead to death.\\n410 CHAPTER 12 \\x81 Female Reproductive System\\nDiseases and Conditions\\nThis section introduces diseases and conditions of the female reproductive system, along with their\\nmeanings and pronunciations.

(See Fig. 13-1.)\\nMale Reproductive Structures\\nThe primary male reproductive organ consists of two (1) testes (singular, testis) located in the \\n(2) scrotum, an external sac lying behind and below the penis. The muscular wall of the scrotum\\nallows for the control of temperature of the testes. It moves the testes closer to the body for\\nwarmth and farther from the body for cooling. The testes produce the hormone testosterone,\\nwhich enables development of secondary sex characteristics, including the growth of facial and\\nbody hair, deepening of the voice, increased muscle mass, and so forth. It also plays an important\\nrole in libido. Within the testes are numerous small tubes that twist and coil to form (3) semi-\\nniferous tubules, which produce sperm, the male gamete. Lying over the superior surface of each\\ntestis is a single, tightly coiled tube called the (4) epididymis. This structure stores sperm after it\\nleaves the seminiferous tubules. The epididymis is the ﬁrst duct through which sperm passes after\\nits production in the testes.

The vas deferens extends over the top and down the pos-\\nterior surface of the bladder, where it joins the (6) seminal vesicle. The seminal vesicle contains\\nnutrients that support sperm viability and produces approximately 60% of the semen (seminal\\nﬂuid) that is ultimately ejaculated during sexual intercourse (coitus). The union of the vas deferens\\nwith the duct from the seminal vesicle forms the (7) ejaculatory duct. The ejaculatory duct joins\\nto the urethra as it passes at an angle through the (8) prostate gland, a triple-lobed organ fused\\nto the base of the bladder. The prostate gland secretes a thin, alkaline substance that accounts for\\nabout 30% of seminal ﬂuid. Its alkalinity helps protect sperm from the acidic environments of the\\nmale urethra and the female vagina. Two pea-shaped structures, the (9) bulbourethral (Cowper)\\nglands, are located below the prostate and are connected by a small duct to the urethra. The bul-\\nbourethral glands provide additional alkaline ﬂuid that neutralizes any residual acidity in the male\\nurethra to further assist in sperm viability. The (10) penis is the male organ of copulation. It is\\ncylindrical and composed of erectile tissue that becomes rigid and erect upon sexual arousal. The\\npenis encloses the (11) urethra that expels both semen and urine from the body. During ejacu-\\nlation, the sphincter at the base of the bladder closes, stopping urine from being expelled with \\nsemen while also preventing semen from entering the bladder.

Signs and symptoms commonly include\\npain, especially during urination; erectile dysfunction; and loss of libido. Performance of a com-\\nplete evaluation of the genitalia, reproductive history, and past and present genitourinary infec-\\ntions and disorders is necessary to identify disorders associated with male reproductive structures.\\nFor diagnosis, treatment, and management of male reproductive disorders, the medical services\\nof a specialist may be warranted. Urology is the branch of medicine concerned with the male \\nreproductive system and urinary disorders in males and females. The physician who specializes in\\ndiagnosis and treatment of genitourinary disorders is known as a urologist.\\nSexually Transmitted Infections\\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs),also called sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), include\\nany contagious disease acquired during sexual activity with an infected partner. In the United States,\\nthe widespread occurrence of STIs is regarded as epidemic. The Centers for Disease Control esti-\\nmates that there are nearly 20 million new STIs annually, and half of these are among young adults\\nbetween 15 and 24 years old. Because genital warts, genital herpes, and trichomonas infections are\\nnot routinely reported, the current statistics of STIs captures only a fraction of the actual number\\nof these cases. Many STIs can lead to severe reproductive problems, including sterility and infertility\\nin males and females and ectopic pregnancy, preterm delivery, and infection transmitted to the new-\\nborn during delivery in females. In addition, many STIs increase the risk of acquiring HIV infec-\\ntion. (See Chapter 9 for a discussion of HIV infection.)\\nGonorrhea\\nGonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrheae.It involves the mucosal surface of the\\ngenitourinary tract and can also involve the rectum and pharynx. This disease spreads through sexual\\nintercourse and through orogenital and anogenital contact. The most common symptoms of gonor-\\nrhea include pain on urination (dysuria) and a white discharge (leukorrhea). Left untreated, the \\ndisease may infect the bladder (cystitis)and inﬂame joints (arthritis). In males, gonorrhea can cause\\nepididymitis that leads to infertility or scarring inside the urethra, making urination diﬃcult. Many\\nwomen are asymptomatic; however, when symptoms are present, they include a vaginal discharge or\\npelvic pain. Scars may develop in the reproductive tubes and cause infertility. The organism can infect\\nthe eyes of the newborn during vaginal delivery, leading to blindness. As a precaution, physicians \\n5867_Ch13_439-474  11/01/17  11:29 AM  Page 446'),\n",

Both sex partners require treatment for gonorrhea because\\nthe infection can recur. The usual treatment is antibiotics.\\nChlamydia\\nChlamydia, caused by infection with the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, is the most prevalent\\nand one of the most damaging STIs in the United States. It is called the “silent disease” because\\nsymptoms are commonly absent or mild, and the disease remains untreated until there is irre-\\nversible damage to the reproductive structures. If symptoms are present, males produce a whitish\\ndischarge from the penis. Inﬂammation of epididymis (epididymitis) can cause pain and swelling\\nin the scrotum. In women, there is a mucopurulent discharge and inﬂammation of the cervix uteri\\n(cervicitis).During the birth process, chlamydia may spread to the newborn baby and cause con-\\njunctivitis or pneumonia. Antibiotics are eﬀective in treating chlamydia infections. Screening for\\nother STIs is important because chlamydia places the individual at higher risk of having other\\nSTIs, including gonorrhea and HIV.\\nSyphilis\\nAlthough less common than gonorrhea, syphilis is the more serious of the two diseases. It is\\ncaused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. If left untreated, syphilis may become a chronic,\\ninfectious, multisystemic disease.\\nSyphilis manifests in three distinct stages. In primary syphilis, a painless sore, called a chancre\\nappears 3 to 90 days after exposure. In secondary syphilis, a body rash that that commonly occurs\\non the palms of the hands and soles of the feet appears 4 to 10 weeks after exposure. A latency\\nperiod of several years usually follows when sign and symptoms are absent or very mild; however,\\nthe individual is still infectious. Tertiary syphilis develops 3 to 15 years after exposure when the\\ndisease spreads throughout the body, especially in the nervous and cardiovascular systems. Early\\ntreatment is very eﬀective, sometimes with just a single injection. Without treatment, the disease\\nbecomes life-threatening, causing blindness, stroke, mental disorders, and eventually, death.\\nGenital Herpes\\nGenital herpes causes red, blisterlike, painful lesions in the genital area that closely resemble fever\\nblisters or cold sores that appear on the lips and around the mouth. Although genital herpes and\\noral herpes are caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), genital herpes is associated with type 2\\n(HSV-2), and oral herpes is associated with type 1 (HSV-1). Regardless, both forms can cause\\noral and genital infections through oral-genital sexual activity. Fluid in the blisters in genital her-\\npes is highly infectious and contains the active virus. However, this disease is communicable even\\nwhen the blisters are not present, through a phenomenon called viral shedding. In men, lesions\\nappear on the glans, foreskin, or penile shaft. In females, lesions appear in the vaginal area, but-\\ntocks, and thighs. Individuals with a herpes infection may have only one episode or may have \\nrepeated attacks that usually lessen in severity over the years. The disease may spread to a baby\\nduring the birth process and, although rare, may lead to death of the infant. Antiviral medication\\ncan relieve pain and discomfort during an outbreak by healing the sores more quickly. However,\\nthere is no cure available for this disease.\\nGenital Warts\\nGenital warts (condylomata, condylomas) are caused by one or more of the many diﬀerent \\nhuman papillomavirus (HPV) strains. The warts may be very small and barely visible or may be\\nlarge and appear in clusters. HPV can spread from one person to another during skin-to-skin\\ncontact and does not require sexual activity. The warts can also spread from one part of the body\\nto another. In males, the lesions commonly appear on the penis or around the rectum. In females,\\nthe lesions commonly appear on the vulva, in the vagina, or on the cervix. \\nSome high-risk strains of HPV are associated with anal and penile cancer in males and vaginal\\nand cervical cancer in females. Females diagnosed with high-risk strains of HPV require regular\\nPap smears. HPV vaccines are available and protect against the high-risk strains. To be eﬀective,\\nyoung adults require vaccination before they begin engaging in sexual activity.\\n5867_Ch13_439-474  11/01/17  11:29 AM  Page 447'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 473}, page_content='Many warts disappear without treatment, but there is no way to determine which ones will \\nresolve. When treatment is required, the usual method is surgical excision or freezing the wart.\\nTrichomoniasis\\nTrichomoniasis, caused by the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis, aﬀects males and females but\\nsymptoms are more common in females. When symptoms are present in males, they include \\nirritation inside the penis, mild discharge, or slight burning during urination (dysuria) or ejacu-\\nlation. In women, trichomonas causes vaginitis, urethritis, and cystitis with discomfort during\\nurination or intercourse. Often there is a frothy, yellow-green vaginal discharge with a strong\\nodor and irritation or itching of the vulva. Both sexual partners require treatment because rein-\\nfection is possible.\\nOncology\\nProstate cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer among men, second only to skin \\ncancer. With early diagnosis and treatment, the prognosis for long-term survival is excellent.\\nIn the United States, men younger than age 50 rarely develop prostate cancer. However, the\\nincidence dramatically increases with age. Early presymptomatic tests include a blood test for\\nprostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA) and periodic digital rectal examination (DRE). In early stages \\nof prostate cancer, symptoms include dysuria, frequency, loss of bladder control, and hematuria.\\nAs prostate cancer progresses, symptoms include blood in the semen, erectile dysfunction, and\\nnumbness or pain in the pelvis.\\nOnce diagnosed, oncologists stage and grade prostate cancer to determine appropriate forms\\nof therapy. Very early stages of prostate cancer may not require medical intervention, and many\\nmen may never need any further treatment. Nevertheless, active surveillance with blood tests, dig-\\nital rectal examinations, and possibly biopsies with follow-up is required.\\nSurgery and radiation therapy are common treatments for prostate cancer. For malignancy con-\\nﬁned only to the prostate, surgery that removes the entire prostate, seminal vesicles, and surround-\\ning lymph nodes (radical prostatectomy) provides the best treatment option. Because testosterone\\nfuels the growth of prostate cancer, hormone therapy, called androgen-deprivation therapy\\n(ADT), is important in the management of the disease. Removal of both testes (bilateral orchiec-\\ntomy, castration) blocks testosterone but is permanent and irreversible, and many men opt for\\ndrug therapy. Drug therapy that includes antiandrogenic agents and hormones that deplete the\\nbody of testicular hormones (combined hormonal therapy) is part of this form of treatment.\\n448 CHAPTER 13 \\x81 Male Reproductive System\\n5867_Ch13_439-474  11/01/17  11:29 AM  Page 448'),\n",

Because\\nof their location, the adrenal glands are also known as suprarenal glands . Each adrenal gland\\nis divided into two sections, each having its own structure and function. The outer adrenal\\ncortex makes up the bulk of the gland, and the adrenal medulla makes up the inner portion.\\nAlthough these regions are not sharply divided, they represent distinct glands that secrete \\ndifferent hormones.\\nAdrenal Cortex\\nThe adrenal cortex secretes three types of steroid hormones:\\n1. Mineralocorticoids, mainly aldosterone, are essential to life. These hormones act\\nmainly through the kidneys to maintain the balance of electrolytes (sodium and \\npotassium) in the body. More specifically, aldosterone causes the kidneys to conserve\\nsodium and excrete potassium (K). At the same time, it promotes water conservation \\nby reducing urine output.\\n2. Glucocorticoids, mainly cortisol, influence the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and\\nproteins. The glucocorticoid with the greatest activity is cortisol. It helps regulate the\\nconcentration of glucose in the blood, protecting against low blood glucose levels \\nbetween meals. Cortisol also stimulates the breakdown of fats in adipose tissue and \\nreleases fatty acids into the blood. The increase in fatty acids causes many cells to use\\nrelatively less glucose.\\n3. Sex hormones, including androgens, estrogens, and progestins, help maintain secondary\\nsex characteristics, such as development of the breasts in females and distribution of body\\nhair in adults.\\nAdrenal Medulla\\nThe cells of the adrenal medulla secrete two closely related hormones: epinephrine (adrenaline)\\nand norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Both hormones are activated when the body responds to\\ncrisis situations, and they are considered sympathomimetic agents because they produce eﬀects\\nthat mimic those brought about by the sympathetic nervous system. Because hormones of the \\nadrenal medulla merely intensify activities set into motion by the sympathetic nervous system,\\ntheir deﬁciency does not cause dysfunction.\\nOf the two hormones, epinephrine is secreted in larger amounts. In the physiological re-\\nsponse to stress, epinephrine is responsible for maintaining blood pressure and cardiac output,\\ndilating airways, and raising blood glucose levels. All of these functions are useful for frightened,\\ntraumatized, injured, or sick persons.

It functions as an exocrine\\nand endocrine gland. In its exocrine role, it carries digestive secretions from the pancreas to the\\nsmall intestine through a large pancreatic duct. The digestive secretions assist in the breakdown\\nof proteins, starches, and fats in the small intestine. In its endocrine role, the pancreas secretes\\ntwo other hormones through the islets of Langerhans: glucagon, which is produced by the alpha\\ncells, and insulin, which is produced by the beta cells. Both hormones play important roles in \\nregulating blood glucose (sugar) levels:\\n• Glucagon stimulates the release of glucose from storage sites in the liver when blood \\nglucose levels are low (hypoglycemia), thereby raising the blood glucose level.\\n5867_Ch14_475-512  11/01/17  11:30 AM  Page 482'),\n",

The thymus functions as part of the body’s immune system (discussed\\nin Chapter 9, Blood, Lymphatic, and Immune Systems) and part of the endocrine system.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 513}, page_content='488 CHAPTER 14 \\x81 Endocrine System\\nDisease Focus\\nDisorders of the endocrine system are caused by underproduction (hyposecretion) or overpro-\\nduction (hypersecretion) of hormones. In general, hyposecretion is treated with drug therapy in\\nthe form of hormone replacement. Hypersecretion is generally treated with surgery. Most hor-\\nmone deﬁciencies result from genetic defects in the glands, surgical removal of the glands, or pro-\\nduction of poor-quality hormones.\\nFor diagnosis, treatment, and management of endocrine disorders, the medical services of a\\nspecialist may be warranted. Endocrinology is the branch of medicine concerned with endocrine\\nglands and hormones. The physician who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of endocrine\\ndisorders is known as an endocrinologist.\\nThyroid Disorders\\nThyroid gland disorders are common and may occur at any time during life. They may be the \\nresult of a developmental problem, injury, disease, or dietary deﬁciency.\\nDeﬁciency of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) that develops in infants is called cretinism.\\nIf not treated, this disorder leads to mental retardation, impaired growth, low body tempera-\\ntures, and abnormal bone formation. Usually these symptoms do not appear at birth because the\\ninfant has received thyroid hormones from the mother’s blood during fetal development. When\\nhypothyroidism develops during adulthood, it is known as myxedema. The signs and symptoms\\nof this disease include edema, low blood levels of T 3 and T 4, weight gain, cold intolerance, \\nfatigue, depression, muscle or joint pain, and sluggishness.\\nHyperthyroidismis a condition in which the thyroid gland produces excessive amounts of thyroid\\nhormone. The most common form is Graves disease, also known as thyrotoxicosis/autoimmune \\nhyperthyroidism,an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system produces autoantibodies\\nthat stimulate the production of excessive thyroid hormone. Another cause of hyperthyroidism is the\\nformation of nodules or lumps on the thyroid gland (toxic nodular or multinodular hyperthy-\\nroidism), causing the excess production of thyroid hormone.\\nSigns and symptoms of hyperthyroidism include an elevated metabolic rate, abnormal weight\\nloss, excessive perspiration, muscle weakness, and emotional instability. Also, the eyes are likely to \\nprotrude (exophthalmos)because of edematous swelling in the tissues behind them. (See Fig. 14-3.)\\nAt the same time, the thyroid gland is likely to enlarge, producing goiter. (See Fig. 14-4.)\\nFigure 14-3 Exophthalmos caused\\nby Graves disease.\\nFigure 14-4 Enlargement of the thyroid\\ngland in goiter.\\n5867_Ch14_475-512  11/01/17  11:30 AM  Page 488'),\n",

Another method for treating\\nthis disorder is to administer a sufficient amount of radioactive iodine to destroy the thyroid\\nsecretory cells.\\nParathyroid Disorders\\nAs with the thyroid gland, dysfunction of the parathyroids is usually characterized by inadequate\\nor excessive hormone secretion. Insuﬃcient production of parathyroid hormone (PTH), called\\nhypoparathyroidism,may be caused by primary parathyroid dysfunction or elevated blood \\ncalcium levels. This condition can result from an injury or from surgical removal of the glands,\\nsometimes in conjunction with thyroid surgery. The primary eﬀect of hypoparathyroidism is a\\ndecreased blood calcium level (hypocalcemia). Decreased calcium causes muscle twitches and\\nspasms (tetany).\\nExcessive production of PTH, called hyperparathyroidism, is commonly caused by a benign\\ntumor. The increase in PTH secretion leads to demineralization of bones (osteitis ﬁbrosa cys-\\ntica), making them porous (osteoporosis) and highly susceptible to fracture and deformity.\\nWhen this condition is the result of a benign glandular tumor (adenoma) of the parathyroid, the\\ntumor is removed. Excess PTH also causes calcium deposits in the kidneys.\\nAdrenal Gland Disorders\\nThe adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla have their own structures and functions and their own\\nsets of associated disorders.\\nAdrenal Cortex\\nThe adrenal cortex is mainly associated with Addison disease and Cushing syndrome.\\nAddison Disease\\nAddison disease, also called corticoadrenal insuﬃciency,is a relatively uncommon chronic disor-\\nder caused by a deﬁciency of cortical hormones. It commonly results from damage to or atrophy of\\nthe adrenal cortex. Hypofunction of the adrenal cortex interferes with the body’s ability to handle\\ninternal and external stress. Other clinical manifestations include muscle weakness, anorexia, gas-\\ntrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, hypoglycemia, hypotension, low blood sodium (hyponatremia),\\nand high serum potassium (hyperkalemia).If treatment for this condition begins early (usually with\\nadrenocortical hormone therapy), the prognosis is excellent. If untreated, the disease will continue\\na chronic course with progressive but relatively slow deterioration. In some patients, the deteriora-\\ntion may be rapid.\\nCushing Syndrome\\nCushing syndrome is a cluster of symptoms produced by excessive amounts of cortisol, adreno-\\ncorticotropic hormone (ACTH), or both circulating in the blood. (See Fig. 14-5, page 490.)\\nCauses of this excess secretion include the following:\\n• Long-term administration of steroid drugs (glucocorticoids) in treating such diseases as\\nrheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, and asthma\\n• Adrenal tumor, resulting in excessive production of cortisol\\n• Cushing disease, a pituitary disorder caused by hypersecretion of ACTH from an adenoma\\nin the anterior pituitary gland.\\nRegardless of the cause, Cushing syndrome alters carbohydrate and protein metabolism and\\nelectrolyte balance. Overproduction of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids causes blood\\nglucose concentration to remain high, depleting tissue protein. In addition, sodium retention\\ncauses increased fluid in tissues, leading to edema. These metabolic changes produce weight\\n5867_Ch14_475-512  11/01/17  11:30 AM  Page 489'),\n",

Other symptoms include fatigue, high blood pres-\\nsure, and excessive hair growth in unusual places (hirsutism), especially in women. The treat-\\nment goal for this disease is to restore serum cortisol to normal levels. Nevertheless, treatment\\nvaries with the cause and may necessitate radiation, drug therapy, surgery, or a combination of\\nthese methods.\\nAdrenal Medulla\\nNo specific diseases can be traced directly to a deficiency of hormones from the adrenal\\nmedulla. However, medullary tumors sometimes cause excess secretions. The most common\\ndisorder is a neoplasm known as pheochromocytoma, which produces excessive amounts of\\nepinephrine and norepinephrine. Most of these tumors are encapsulated and benign. These\\nhypersecretions produce high blood pressure, rapid heart rate, stress, fear, palpitations,\\nheadaches, visual blurring, muscle spasms, and sweating. Typical treatment consists of anti-\\nhypertensive drugs and surgery.\\nPancreatic Disorders\\nBy far, the most common pancreatic disorder is diabetes. Diabetes is a general term that, when\\nused alone, refers to diabetes mellitus (DM). DM is a chronic metabolic disorder of impaired car-\\nbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism resulting from insuﬃcient production of insulin or the\\nbody’s inability to use insulin properly. When body cells are deprived of glucose, their principal\\nenergy fuel, they begin to metabolize proteins and fats. Fat metabolism produces ketones, which\\nenter the blood, causing a condition called ketosis. Hyperglycemia and ketosis are responsible for\\nthe host of troubling and, commonly, life-threatening symptoms of diabetes mellitus.\\n490 CHAPTER 14 \\x81 Endocrine System\\nFigure 14-5 Physical manifestations of Cushing syndrome.\\nThinning hair\\nBuffalo hump\\nSupraclavicular\\nfat pad\\nEasy bruising\\nThin extremities\\nSlow wound\\nhealing\\nPendulous \\nabdomen\\nPurple striae\\nMoon face\\nIncreased body\\nand facial hair\\n5867_Ch14_475-512  11/01/17  11:30 AM  Page 490'),\n",

Diabetes\\nmellitus occurs in two primary forms: type 1 and type 2.\\nType 1 Diabetes\\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. It is usually diagnosed in children and young adults. In\\ntype 1 diabetes, the body does not produce a suﬃcient amount of insulin. Like all autoimmune \\ndiseases, it requires constant monitoring and medicating. Blood glucose levels are monitored by the\\npatient several times a day using a glucometerto determine the amount of insulin needed to control\\nblood sugar levels. The patient administers insulin injections as needed. Insulin injections should be\\nadministered in a diﬀerent subcutaneous site each time to avoid injury to the tissues. (See Fig. 14-6.)\\nType 2 Diabetes\\nIn type 2 diabetes , either the body’s cells are resistant to insulin or the pancreas is deﬁcient in\\nproducing insulin. In both cases, the body’s cells do not absorb glucose, and it remains in the\\nblood, causing hyperglycemia. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form and is distinctively\\ndiﬀerent from type 1. Its onset is typically later in life; however, it has become more prevalent\\nin children as the incidence of obesity has increased. Risk factors include a family history of \\ndiabetes and obesity.

The etiology is unknown, but cigarette smoking, exposure to occu-\\npational chemicals, a diet high in fats, and heavy coﬀee intake are associated with an increased\\nincidence of pancreatic cancer.\\nPituitary Tumors\\nPituitary tumors are abnormal growths that develop in the pituitary gland. Some pituitary \\ntumors cause excessive production of hormones that regulate important functions of the body.\\nOther pituitary tumors can restrict normal function of the pituitary gland, causing it to produce\\nlower levels of hormones. The vast majority of pituitary tumors are noncancerous (benign)\\ngrowths known as adenomas. Adenomas remain conﬁned to the pituitary gland or surrounding\\ntissues and do not spread to other parts of the body. As the tumor grows, it can cause a variety\\nof symptoms, including compression of nearby nerves, resulting in vision problems. Treatment\\ninvolves removing the tumor, especially if it is pressing on the optic nerves, which could cause\\nblindness. Removal of pituitary tumors commonly occurs through the nose and sphenoid sinuses\\n(transsphenoidal hypophysectomy).Other treatment modalities include restoring normal hor-\\nmone levels or radiation therapy to shrink the tumor.

Together, neurons and neuroglia constitute the nervous tissue of the body.\\nNeurons\\nNeurons transmit impulses. Depending on the direction in which they transmit information,\\nneurons and nerves are classiﬁed as afferent (when the impulse moves toward the brain or spinal\\ncord) or efferent (when the impulse moves away from the brain or spinal cord). The three major\\nstructures of the neuron are the cell body, axon, and dendrites. (See Fig. 15-1.)

Its branching cytoplasmic projections are (3) dendrites that carry impulses to the cell\\nbody and (4) axons that carry impulses from the cell body. Dendrites resemble tiny branches on\\na tree, providing additional surface area for receiving impulses from other neurons. Axons are\\nthreadlike extensions of nerve cells that transmit impulses to dendrites of other neurons and to\\nmuscles and glands.\\nAxons possess a white, lipoid covering called a (5) myelin sheath. This covering acts as an electrical\\ninsulator that reduces the possibility of an impulse stimulating adjacent nerves. It also accelerates im-\\npulse transmission through the axon. On nerves in the peripheral nervous system,the myelin sheath\\nis formed by a neuroglial cell called a (6) Schwann cellthat wraps tightly around the axon. Its exterior\\nsurface forms a thin tube called the (7) neurilemma, or neurolemma. The neurilemma acts as a pro-\\ntective coat for peripheral neurons. If the neurilemma covering remains intact after an injury to the\\nnerve, it forms a tube that provides a pathway for possible neuron regeneration after injury.\\nOligodendrocytes, rather than Schwann cells, form the myelin sheath that covers the axons in\\nthe central nervous system. Oligodendrocytes do not produce neurilemma, and thus injury or\\ndamage to neurons located in the central nervous system is irreparable. The short, unmyelinated\\nspaces between adjacent segments of the myelin sheath are called (8) nodes of Ranvier. These\\nnodes help speed the transmission of impulses down the axon.\\nThe functional connection between two neurons or between a neuron and its eﬀector organ \\n(muscle or gland) is a gap or space called a (9) synapse. Impulses must travel from the (10) axon ter-\\nminal of one neuron to the dendrite of the next neuron or to its eﬀector organ by crossing this\\nsynapse. The impulse within the transmitting axon causes a chemical substance called a (11) neuro-\\ntransmitter to be released at the end of its axon. The neurotransmitter diﬀuses across the synapse and\\nattaches to the receiving neuron at specialized receptor sites. When suﬃcient receptor sites are occu-\\npied, it signals an acceptance “message” and the impulse passes to the receiving neuron. The receiving\\nneuron immediately inactivates the neurotransmitter and prepares the site to receive another impulse.\\nNeuroglia\\nNeuroglia are cells that support neurons and bind them to other neurons or other tissues of the\\nbody. Although they do not transmit impulses, they provide a variety of activities essential to the\\nproper functioning of neurons. The term neuroglia literally means “nerve glue” because these cells\\nwere originally believed to serve only to bind neurons to each other and to other structures. They\\nare now known to supply nutrients and oxygen to neurons and assist in other metabolic activities.\\nThey also play an important role when the nervous system suﬀers injury or infection. The four major\\ntypes of neuroglia are astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and ependyma. (See Fig. 15-2.)\\nAstrocytes, as their name suggests, are star-shaped neuroglia. They provide three-dimensional\\nmechanical support for neurons and form tight sheaths around the capillaries of the brain. These\\nsheaths provide an obstruction called the blood–brain barrier that keeps large molecular sub-\\nstances from entering the delicate tissue of the brain. Even so, small molecules, such as water, \\ncarbon dioxide, oxygen, and alcohol, readily pass from blood vessels through the barrier and enter\\nthe interstitial spaces of the brain. Researchers must consider the blood–brain barrier when devel-\\noping drugs that treat brain disorders. Astrocytes also perform mildly phagocytic functions in the\\nbrain and spinal cord. Oligodendrocytes, also called oligodendroglia, are responsible for devel-\\noping myelin on the axons of neurons in the central nervous system. Microglia, the smallest of\\nthe neuroglia, possess phagocytic properties and become very active during times of infection.\\nEpendyma are ciliated cells that line the ﬂuid-ﬁlled cavities of the central nervous system, espe-\\ncially the ventricles of the brain. They assist in the circulation of cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF).\\nNervous System Divisions\\nThe two major divisions of the nervous system are the central nervous system and the peripheral\\nnervous system. The central nervous system consists of all nervous tissue located in the brain and\\nspinal cord. The peripheral nervous system includes all nervous tissue located outside the central\\nnervous system and consists of cranial and spinal nerves.

It consists of two hemispheres\\ndivided by a deep longitudinal ﬁssure, or groove. The ﬁssure does not completely separate the\\nhemispheres. A structure called the (2) corpus callosum joins these hemispheres, permitting\\ncommunication between the right and left sides of the brain. Each hemisphere consists of \\nﬁve lobes. Four of these lobes are named for the bones that lie directly above them: (3) frontal,\\n(4) parietal, (5) temporal, and (6) occipital. The ﬁfth lobe, the insula (not shown in Fig. 15-3),\\nis hidden from view and can be seen only upon dissection.\\nThe cerebral surface consists of numerous folds, or convolutions, called gyri. The gyri are sep-\\narated by furrows, or ﬁssures, called sulci. A thin layer called the cerebral cortex covers the entire\\ncerebrum and is composed of gray matter. Most information processing occurs in the cerebral\\ncortex. The remainder of the cerebrum is primarily composed of white matter (myelinated axons).\\nMajor functions of the cerebrum include sensory perception and interpretation, language, vol-\\nuntary movement, and memory. Beneath the cerebrum is a primitive “emotional brain” called the\\nlimbic system . The limbic system is essential for survival and works in conjunction with the\\n“thinking brain.” It controls such behaviors as rage, fear, and anger and such emotional aspects as\\nfood enjoyment and sexual behavior. Mental and emotional illnesses are commonly the result of\\nan imbalance in brain chemicals or electrical activity in the limbic system.\\nCerebellum\\nThe second largest structure of the brain, the (7) cerebellum, occupies the posterior portion of\\nthe skull. Most functions of the cerebellum involve movement, posture, or balance. When the\\ncerebrum initiates muscular movement, the cerebellum coordinates and reﬁnes it.\\nDiencephalon\\nThe (8) diencephalon (also called the interbrain) is composed of many smaller structures, includ-\\ning the thalamus and the hypothalamus. The (9) thalamus receives all sensory stimuli except \\nolfactory stimuli and processes and transmits them to the appropriate centers in the cerebral cor-\\ntex. In addition, the thalamus receives impulses from the cerebrum and relays them to eﬀerent\\nnerves. The (10) hypothalamus regulates involuntary activities, such as heart rate, body temper-\\nature, and ﬂuid balance. It also controls many endocrine functions.\\nBrainstem\\nThe brainstem is composed of three structures: the (11) midbrain (also called the mesen-\\ncephalon), separating the cerebrum from the brainstem; the (12) medulla, which attaches to \\nthe spinal cord; and (13) the pons, or “bridge,” connecting the midbrain to the medulla. In gen-\\neral, the brainstem is a pathway for impulse conduction between the brain and spinal cord. The\\nbrainstem is the origin of 10 of the 12 pairs of cranial nerves and controls respiration, blood pres-\\nsure, and heart rate. The brainstem is the site that controls the beginning of life (initiation of the\\nheartbeat in a fetus) and the end of life (cessation of respiration and heart activity).\\nSpinal Cord\\nThe spinal cord transmits sensory impulses from the body to the brain and motor impulses from\\nthe brain to the muscles and organs of the body. The sensory nerve tracts are called ascending\\ntracts because the direction of the impulse is upward. Conversely, motor nerve tracts are called\\ndescending tracts because they carry impulses in a downward direction to muscles and organs. A\\ncross-sectional view of the spinal cord reveals an inner area of gray matter composed of cell bodies\\nand dendrites and an outer area of white matter composed of myelinated tissue of the ascending\\nand descending tracts.\\nThe entire spinal cord is located within the spinal cavity of the vertebral column, with spinal\\nnerves exiting between the intervertebral spaces throughout almost the entire length of the spinal\\ncolumn. Unlike the cranial nerves, which have speciﬁc names, the spinal nerves are identiﬁed by\\nthe region of the vertebral column from which they exit.\\nMeninges\\nThe brain and spinal cord receive limited protection from three coverings called meninges\\n(singular, meninx). These coverings are the dura mater, arachnoid, and pia mater.\\nAnatomy and Physiology 519\\n5867_Ch15_513-560  20/01/17  1:35 PM  Page 519'),\n",

Beneath the dura mater is a cavity called the subdural space,\\nwhich is ﬁlled with serous ﬂuid.\\nThe arachnoid is the middle covering and, as its name suggests, has a spider-web appearance.\\nIt ﬁts loosely over the underlying structures. A subarachnoid space contains cerebrospinal ﬂuid,\\na colorless ﬂuid that contains proteins, glucose, urea, salts, and some white blood cells. This ﬂuid\\ncirculates around the spinal cord and brain and through ventricles located within the inner portion\\nof the brain. It provides nutritive substances to the central nervous system and adds additional pro-\\ntection for the brain and spinal cord by acting as a shock absorber. Normally, cerebrospinal ﬂuid\\nis absorbed as rapidly as it is formed, maintaining a constant ﬂuid volume. Any interference with\\nits absorption results in a collection of ﬂuid in the brain, a condition called hydrocephalus.\\nThe pia mater is the innermost meninx. This membrane directly adheres to the brain and\\nspinal cord. As it passes over the brain, it follows the contours of the gyri and sulci. It contains\\nnumerous blood vessels and lymphatics that nourish the underlying tissues. Because of the thin-\\nness and delicacy of the arachnoid and pia mater, these two meninges are collectively called the\\nleptomeninges.\\nPeripheral Nervous System\\nThe peripheral nervous system (PNS) is composed of all nervous tissue located outside the spinal\\ncolumn and skull. It consists of sensory neurons, which carry impulses from the body to the CNS\\n(aﬀerent),and motor neurons, which carry impulses from the brain and spinal cord to muscles\\nand glands (eﬀerent). The PNS is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic\\nnervous system. Some motor nerves in the peripheral nervous system innervate muscles under\\nconscious control of the individual. They regulate such actions as walking and talking. The motor\\nnerves that inﬂuence voluntary muscles comprise the somatic nervous system. Other motor\\nnerves innervate involuntary muscles (muscles of the digestive or respiratory organs), glands, and\\ncardiac muscles. The motor nerves that inﬂuence involuntary muscles, glands, and heart muscle\\nmake up the autonomic nervous system.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 554}, page_content='Disease Focus\\nDamage to the brain and spinal cord invariably causes signs and symptoms in other parts of the\\nbody. Common signs and symptoms for many neurological disorders include headache, insom-\\nnia, back or neck pain, weakness, and involuntary movement (dyskinesia). Careful observation of\\nthe patient during the history and physical examination may provide valuable clues about mental\\nstatus and cognitive and motor ability.\\nFor diagnosis, treatment, and management of neurological disorders, the medical services of a\\nspecialist may be warranted. Neurology is the branch of medicine concerned with neurological\\ndiseases. The physician who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of nervous system disorders\\nis known as a neurologist. Psychiatry is the branch of medicine concerned with mental illnesses.\\nThe physician who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental illnesses is a psychiatrist.\\nCerebrovascular Disease\\nCerebrovascular disease is a group of disorders aﬀecting the vessels that supply blood to the\\nbrain. Denied oxygen, brain tissue begins to die, a medical emergency called stroke, cerebrovas-\\ncular accident (CVA), or “brain attack.” The three major types of stroke are ischemic stroke, \\nintracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The causes of an ischemic stroke are\\nsimilar to that of a heart attack and include emboli, thrombi, and atherosclerosis that limit blood\\nﬂow to brain tissue. A common cause of ischemic stroke is atherosclerosis of the arteries of the\\nbrain or neck (carotid). An intracerebral hemorrhage occurs when there is a sudden rupture \\nof an artery within the brain. After the rupture, released blood compresses brain structures and\\ndestroys them. In a subarachnoid hemorrhage, blood is released into the space between the brain\\nand the tissues that surround the brain. This condition is commonly caused by a ruptured\\naneurysm and is usually fatal.\\nDepending on the area of the brain aﬀected by the stroke, signs and symptoms include weakness\\nor paralysis in one-half of the body (hemiparesis, hemiplegia), speech diﬃculty (dysphasia), lack\\nof muscle coordination (ataxia), confusion, and loss of consciousness. A “mini stroke,” also called\\na transient ischemic attack (TIA), is a type of stroke in which symptoms resolve within 24 hours\\nand do not cause permanent damage. TIAs require immediate medical attention because they are\\noften a precursor to a full-blown stroke.\\nRisk factors for stroke include family history, obesity, smoking, and excessive alcohol use. \\nBecause high blood pressure is a risk factor for strokes, antihypertensive medications are impor-\\ntant in prevention.\\nComputed tomography (CT) helps determine the type of stroke and treatment options. For\\nischemic strokes, “clot-buster” (thrombolytic) medications administered within 3 hours of symp-\\ntom onset can usually prevent permanent disability. Treatment for disabilities caused by stroke\\ninvolves speech, physical, and occupational therapy and various medications, depending on the\\ntype of stroke.\\nSeizure Disorders\\nSeizure disorders include any medical condition characterized by sudden changes in behavior or\\nconsciousness caused by uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain. They include epileptic\\nseizures, which have no known cause, are chronic, and occur repeatedly, and nonepileptic\\nseizures, which are triggered by disorders or conditions that irritate the brain. These triggers\\ncommonly include brain injury, congenital anomalies, metabolic disorders, brain tumors, fever,\\nvascular disturbances, and genetic disorders.\\nWhether epileptic or nonepileptic, seizures manifest in various forms. The two most common\\nforms are partial seizures and generalized seizures. In partial seizures, only a portion of the\\nbrain is involved. There is a short alteration of consciousness of about 10 to 30 seconds with repet-\\nitive, unusual movements and confusion. In a generalized seizure, the entire brain is involved.\\nThe most common type of generalized seizure is the tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure. In tonic-\\nclonic seizures, the body alternates between excessive muscle tone and rigidity (tonic) and jerking\\nDisease Focus 529\\n5867_Ch15_513-560  20/01/17  1:35 PM  Page 529'),\n",

After the seizure, such neurological symptoms as\\nweakness, confusion, headache, and nausea may occur. These symptoms are called a postictal\\nevent, which commonly lasts for 5 to 30 minutes but may last longer with a severe seizure.\\nMany patients experience a warning signal (aura) of an imminent seizure. Auras vary consid-\\nerably and may include sensory phenomena without a precipitating stimulus, such as a strange\\ntaste in the mouth, the sound of a ringing bell, or an inability to react properly to usual situations.\\nAuras provide time for preparation, such as lying down, avoiding staircases, and so forth, to min-\\nimize injuries should a grand mal seizure occur.\\nDiagnosis and evaluation of epilepsies commonly rely on electroencephalography and mag-\\nnetic source imaging (MSI) to locate the aﬀected area of the brain. Antiepileptic medications\\nhelp control seizures.\\nMultiple Sclerosis\\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that targets the myelin sheath on the nerves\\nof the central nervous system. MS causes inﬂammation, hardening (sclerosing), and, ﬁnally, loss\\nof myelin (demyelination) throughout the spinal cord and brain. Myelin deterioration impedes\\nthe transmission of electrical impulses from one neuron to another. In eﬀect, the pathway of\\nnerve impulses develops “short circuits,” producing a wide variety of symptoms.\\nSigns and symptoms of MS include tremors, muscle weakness, bradykinesia, and such visual\\ndisturbances as blurred vision, poor contrast, double vision, and eye pain. Other symptoms \\ninclude bowel and bladder disorders, sexual disfunction, balance problems, cognitive diﬃculties,\\nnumbness, tingling, and pain. Many patients require a cane, walker, or wheelchair as the disease\\nprogresses. During remissions, symptoms temporarily disappear, but progressive hardening of\\nmyelinated areas leads to other attacks. MS generally aﬀects a person’s quality of life, rather than\\nlongevity. Medications and physical therapy can ease or control symptoms, but currently there is\\nno cure for the disease.\\nMental Illness\\nMental illness includes an array of psychological disorders, syndromes, and behavioral patterns\\nthat cause alterations in mood, behavior, and thinking. Its forms range from mild to serious.\\nMental illness is a disease that aﬀects mood, thought, behavior, or all three, with symptoms rang-\\ning from mild to severe. Signs and symptoms include excessive fears, strong feelings of anger, hal-\\nlucinations, extreme highs and lows, confused thinking, and prolonged depression. Although\\nmany people may experience one or more of these problems from time to time, when any of them\\nare ongoing and aﬀect the person’s ability to meet the demands of daily life, it is considered a\\nmental illness. Causes of mental illness include genetic factors; prenatal environment, including\\nexposure to drugs and alcohol; biochemical imbalances; and stress. Left untreated, mental illness\\ncan cause relationship diﬃculties, social isolation, poverty, and homelessness.\\nDiagnosis and treatment of serious mental disorders usually requires the skills of a medical spe-\\ncialist called a psychiatrist. In the capacity of a physician, the psychiatrist is licensed to prescribe\\nmedications and perform medical procedures not available to those who do not hold a medical \\nlicense. Psychiatrists commonly work in association with clinical psychologists, individuals\\ntrained in evaluating human behavior, intelligence, and personality. (See Table 15-3.)\\nResearch and education have removed much of the stigma attached to mental illness. Today,\\nmental illness is becoming a more recognizable and treatable disorder. Family physicians, school\\npsychologists, marriage and family counselors, and even such support groups as grief support and\\nAlcoholics Anonymous can eﬀectively help in managing psychological problems.\\n530 CHAPTER 15 \\x81 Nervous System\\n5867_Ch15_513-560  20/01/17  1:35 PM  Page 530'),\n",

(See Fig. 16-1.)\\nFibrous Tunic\\nThe outermost layer of the eyeball, the ﬁbrous tunic, serves as a protective coat for the more sen-\\nsitive structures beneath. It includes the (1) sclera, (2) cornea, and (3) conjunctiva. The sclera,\\nor “white of the eye,” provides strength, shape, and structure to the eye. As the sclera passes in\\nfront of the eye, it bulges forward to become the cornea. Rather than being opaque, the cornea\\nis transparent, allowing light to enter the interior of the eye. The cornea is one of the few body\\nstructures that does not contain capillaries and must rely on eye ﬂuids for nourishment. The con-\\njunctiva covers the outer surface of the eye and lines the eyelids.\\nVascular Tunic\\nThe middle layer of the eyeball, the vascular tunic, is also known as the uvea. The uvea consists\\nof the choroid, iris, and ciliary body. The (4) choroid provides the blood supply for the entire eye.\\nIt contains pigmented cells that prevent extraneous light from entering the inside of the eye. An\\nopening in the choroid allows the optic nerve to enter the inside of the eyeball. The anterior por-\\ntion of the choroid contains two modiﬁed structures, the (5) iris and the (6) ciliary body. The iris\\nis a colored, contractile membrane with a perforated center called the (7) pupil. The iris regulates\\nthe amount of light passing through the pupil to the interior of the eye. As environmental light\\nincreases, the pupil constricts; as light decreases, the pupil dilates. The ciliary body is a circular\\nmuscle that produces aqueous humor. The ciliary body is attached to a capsular bag that holds\\nthe (8) lens between the (9) suspensory ligaments. As the ciliary muscle contracts and relaxes, it\\nAnatomy and Physiology 563\\n(8) Lens\\n(3) Conjunctiva\\n(2) Cornea\\n(5) Iris\\n(7) Pupil\\n(15) Anterior chamber\\n(16) Canal of \\n        Schlemm\\n(6) Ciliary body\\n   \\n(9) Suspensory\\nligament\\nInferior rectus\\nmuscle\\n(1) Sclera\\n(4) Choroid\\n(10) Retina\\n(13) Optic disk\\n(12) Optic nerve\\nRetinal artery\\nand vein\\n(11) Fovea \\n(in macula)\\n(17) Vitreous \\n      chamber (14) Posterior chamber\\n5867_Ch16_561-604  11/01/17  4:30 PM  Page 563'),\n",

These changes in shape allow the eye to\\nfocus on an image, a process called accommodation (Acc).\\nSensory Tunic\\nThe innermost sensory tunic is the delicate, double-layered (10) retina. It consists of a thin, outer\\npigmented layerlying over the choroid and a thick, inner nervous layer,or visual portion. The retina\\nis responsible for the reception and transmission of visual impulses to the brain. It has two types of\\nvisual receptors: rods and cones. Rods function in dim light and produce black-and-white vision.\\nCones function in bright light and produce color vision. In the central portion of the retina is a highly\\nsensitive structure called the macula. In the center of the macula is the (11) fovea. When the eye \\nfocuses on an object, light rays from that object are directed to the fovea. Because the fovea is com-\\nposed of only cones that lie very close to each other, it provides the greatest acuity for color vision.\\nRods and cones contain a chemical called photopigment, or visual pigment. As light strikes\\nthe photopigment, a chemical change occurs that stimulates rods and cones. The chemical changes\\nproduce impulses that are transmitted through the (12) optic nerve to the brain, where they are\\ninterpreted as vision. The optic nerve and blood vessels of the eye enter at the (13) optic disc. Its\\ncenter is referred to as the blind spot because the area has neither rods nor cones for vision.\\nOne of two major ﬂuids (humors) of the eye is aqueous humor. It is found in the (14) posterior\\nchamber and (15) anterior chamber of the anterior portion of the eye and provides nourishment\\nfor the lens and the cornea. The ciliary body continually produces aqueous humor, which drains\\nfrom the eye through a small opening called the (16) canal of Schlemm. If aqueous humor fails \\nto drain from the eye at the rate at which it is produced, a condition called glaucoma results. The\\nsecond major humor of the eye is vitreous humor, a jellylike substance that ﬁlls the interior of eye,\\nthe (17) vitreous chamber. The vitreous humor, lens, and aqueous humor are the refractive struc-\\ntures of the eye, focusing light rays sharply on the retina. If any one of these structures does not\\nfunction properly, vision is impaired.\\nAdnexa\\nThe adnexa of the eye include all supporting structures of the eye globe. Six extraocular muscles\\ncontrol the movement of the eye: the superior, inferior, lateral, and medial rectus muscles and the\\nsuperior and inferior oblique muscles. These muscles coordinate the eyes so that they move in \\na synchronized manner. In normal vision, each eye views an image from a somewhat diﬀerent\\nvantage point, thus transmitting a slightly diﬀerent image to the brain. The result is binocular \\nperception of depth or three-dimensional space, a phenomenon known as stereopsis.\\nTwo movable folds of skin constitute the eyelids, each with eyelashes that are highly sensi-\\ntive to touch, thus providing a warning that triggers a blink reflex when dust or other irritants\\nare near the eye. (See Fig. 16-2.)

It lubricates the eye by producing mucus and tears, although a smaller volume than\\nthe tears associated with the lacrimal apparatus. Lying superior and to the outer edge of each\\neye are the (2) lacrimal glands, which produce tears that bathe and lubricate the eyes. The tears\\ncollect at the inner edges of the eyes, the canthi (singular, canthus), and pass through pinpoint\\nopenings, the (3) lacrimal canals, to the mucous membranes that line the inside of the \\n(4) nasal cavity.\\nEar\\nThe ear is the sense receptor organ for two senses: hearing and equilibrium. Hearing is a function\\nof the cochlea. Equilibrium is a function of the semicircular canals and vestibule.\\nHearing\\nThe ear consists of three major sections: the outer ear, or external ear; the middle ear, or tym-\\npanic cavity; and the inner ear, or labyrinth . (See Fig. 16-3.) The external ear conducts sound\\nwaves through air; the middle ear, through bone; and the inner ear, through fluid. This series\\nof transmissions ultimately generates impulses that are sent to the brain and interpreted as\\nsound.\\nAn (1) auricle (or pinna) collects waves traveling through air and channels them to the \\n(2) external auditory canal, also called the ear canal. The ear canal is a slender tube lined with\\nglands that produce a waxy secretion called cerumen.

The (3) tympanic membrane\\n(also called the tympanum or eardrum) is a flat, membranous structure drawn over the end of\\nthe ear canal. Sound waves entering the ear canal strike against the tympanic membrane, caus-\\ning it to vibrate.

A membrane-covered opening on the \\nexternal surface of the cochlea called the (8) oval window provides a place for attachment of\\nthe stapes. The movement of the ossicles in the middle ear causes the stapes to exert a gentle\\npumping action against the oval window. The pumping action forces the perilymph to disturb\\nthe hair cells, generating impulses that are transmitted to the brain by way of the auditory\\nnerve, where they are interpreted as sound.

However, many disorders of the eye are serious but asymptomatic;\\ntherefore, regular eye checkups are necessary. For diagnosis, treatment, and management of visual\\ndisorders, the medical services of a specialist may be warranted. Ophthalmology is the medical\\nspecialty concerned with disorders of the eye. The physician who treats these disorders is called\\nan ophthalmologist. Optometrists work with ophthalmologists in a medical practice or practice\\nindependently. Optometrists are not medical doctors but are doctors of optometry (O.D.). They\\ndiagnose vision problems and eye diseases, prescribe eyeglasses and contact lenses, and prescribe\\ndrugs to treat eye disorders. Although they cannot perform surgery, they commonly provide pre-\\noperative and postoperative care.\\nCommon signs and symptoms of ear disorders include hearing impairment, ringing in the ears,\\npain or drainage from the ears, loss of balance, dizziness, and nausea. For diagnosis, treatment,\\nand management of hearing disorders, the medical services of a specialist may be warranted. \\nOtolaryngology is the medical specialty concerned with disorders of the ear, nose, and throat\\n(ENT). The physician who treats these disorders is called an otolaryngologist. Many otolaryn-\\ngologists employ audiologists. The audiologist specializes in nonmedical management of the \\nauditory and balance systems. Using various testing strategies (such as hearing tests, otoacoustic\\nemission measurements, and electrophysiologic tests), the audiologist aims to determine whether\\na person can hear within the normal range and, if not, which portions of hearing (high, middle,\\nor low frequencies) are aﬀected and to what degree. If there is a hearing loss or vestibular abnor-\\nmality, an audiologist may recommend a hearing aid, cochlear implant, or surgery or provide an\\nappropriate medical referral.\\nEye Disorders\\nCommon eye disorders include glaucoma and macular degeneration.\\nGlaucoma\\nGlaucoma is characterized by increased intraocular pressure (IOP) caused by failure of aqueous\\nhumor to drain from the eye through a tiny duct called the canal of Schlemm. (See Fig. 16-4,\\npage 574.) The increased pressure on the optic nerve destroys it, and vision is permanently lost.\\nAlthough there are various forms of glaucoma, all of them eventually lead to blindness unless\\nthe physician detects and treats the condition in its early stages. Glaucoma may occur as a primary\\nor congenital disease or secondary to other causes, such as injury, infection, surgery, or prolonged\\ntopical corticosteroid use. Primary glaucoma can be chronic or acute. The chronic form is also\\ncalled open-angle, simple, or wide-angle glaucoma. The acute form is called angle-closure or\\nnarrow-angle glaucoma. Chronic glaucoma may produce no symptoms except gradual loss of\\nperipheral vision over a period of years. Headaches, blurred vision, and dull pain in the eye may\\nalso be present. During an ophthalmoscopic examination, cupping of the optic discs is visible.\\nAcute glaucoma causes extreme ocular pain, blurred vision, redness of the eye, and dilation of the\\npupil. Nausea and vomiting may also occur. If untreated, acute glaucoma causes complete and\\npermanent blindness within 2 to 5 days.\\nThe more common and chronic form of glaucoma is open-angle glaucoma, which is slow to\\ndevelop and is usually painless. By the time the patient seeks medical attention, it may be too late\\nto restore vision. The rarer form of glaucoma is closed-angle glaucoma. Because of pain and the\\nrapid decrease in vision, the patient generally seeks medical attention before visual ﬁeld (VF) is\\nlost or blindness has occurred. Treatment for glaucoma includes medications that cause the pupils\\nto constrict (miotics), which permits aqueous humor to escape from the eye, thereby relieving\\npressure. If miotics are ineﬀective, surgery may be necessary.\\nDisease Focus 573\\n5867_Ch16_561-604  11/01/17  4:30 PM  Page 573'),\n",

In its most severe form, otitis media may lead to infection of the mastoid process\\n(mastoiditis) or inﬂammation of brain tissue near the middle ear (otoencephalitis). Recurrent\\nepisodes of otitis media may cause scarring of the tympanic membrane, leading to hearing loss.\\nTreatment consists of bedrest, medications to relieve pain (analgesics), and antibiotics.

The ossicle most commonly aﬀected is the\\nstapes, the bone that attaches to the oval window of the cochlea. The formation of a spongy\\ngrowth at the footplate of the stapes decreases its ability to move the oval window, resulting in\\nhearing loss. Occasionally, the patient perceives a ringing sound (tinnitus) within the ear and \\nexperiences dizziness and a progressive loss of hearing, especially of low tones. Development of\\notosclerosis is typically tied to genetic factors; if one or both parents have the disorder, the child\\nis at high risk for developing the disease. Surgical correction involves removing part of the stapes\\n(stapedectomy or, more commonly, stapedotomy) and implanting a prosthetic device that allows\\nsound waves to pass to the inner ear. The procedure requires only a local anesthetic and usually\\nlasts only 45 minutes. Hearing is immediately restored.\\nOncology\\nOncological disorders can occur in almost any structure of the eye or ear as a primary malignancy\\nor spread from other areas of the body to the eye or ear via metastasis.\\nEye\\nTwo major neoplastic diseases account for more than 90% of all primary intraocular diseases:\\nretinoblastoma, found primarily in children, and melanoma, found primarily in adults. Most\\nretinoblastomas tend to be familial. The cell involved is the retinal neuron. Vision is impaired,\\nand in about 30% of patients, the disease is found in both eyes (bilateral).\\nMelanoma may occur in the orbit, the bony cavity of the eyeball, the iris, or the ciliary body,\\nbut it arises most commonly in the pigmented cells of the choroid. The disease is usually asymp-\\ntomatic until there is a hemorrhage into the anterior chamber. An ophthalmologist should examine\\nany discrete, ﬂeshy mass on the iris. If malignancy occurs in the choroid, it usually appears as a\\nbrown or gray mushroom-shaped lesion.\\nTreatment for retinoblastoma usually involves the removal of the aﬀected eye(s) (enucleation),\\nfollowed by radiation. Melanoma in which the lesion is on the iris requires iridectomy. For\\nmelanoma of the choroid, enucleation is necessary. Many eye tumors are noninvasive and are not\\nnecessarily life threatening.\\nEar\\nMalignant and nonmalignant tumors can arise in the external ear, the canal, or the middle ear.\\nMalignant tumors of the ear include basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell tumors. \\nThe most common ear malignancy is basal cell carcinoma, which usually occurs on the top of\\nthe pinna as the result of sun exposure. It is found more commonly in elderly patients or those\\nwith fair skin. Small, craterlike ulcers form as the disease progresses. Basal cell carcinoma does\\nnot readily metastasize. However, failure to treat it in a timely manner may result in the need for\\nextensive surgery to remove the tumor.\\nSquamous cell carcinoma, on the other hand, is much more invasive. However, it is a very\\nrare type of ear tumor. In appearance, it closely resembles basal cell carcinoma, and biopsy is \\nrequired to make a deﬁnitive diagnosis. Squamous cell carcinoma grows more slowly than basal\\ncell carcinoma; however, because of its tendency to metastasize to the surrounding nodes and the\\nnodes of the neck, it must be removed. Surgery combined with radiation therapy is the most \\neﬀective treatment for squamous cell carcinoma.\\n576 CHAPTER 16 \\x81 Special Senses\\n5867_Ch16_561-604  11/01/17  4:30 PM  Page 576'),\n",

Diacritical marks\\nare used to show vowel sounds, and capitalization is used to show emphasis.\\nDiacritical marks are symbols placed above the vowels. They show vowel sounds. In this text, only two\\ndiacritical marks are used: the macron ( -) and the breve (˘).\\nThe macron indicates the long sound \\nof vowels, as in the following examples:\\n• ā in rate\\n• ē in rebirth\\n• ī in isle\\n• ō in over\\n• ū in unite\\nCapitalization is used to indicate the primary accent. For example, the pronunciation L ˘ET-t ˘er indi-\\ncates that emphasis should be placed on the ﬁrst syllable when pronouncing the word letter.\\nThe breve indicates the short sound \\nof vowels, as in the following examples:\\n• ă in apple\\n• ˘e in ever\\n• ˘ı in it\\n• ˘o in not\\n• ˘u in cut\\n5867_IBC  11/01/17  11:33 AM  Page 1')]"
